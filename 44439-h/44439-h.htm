<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Ward Beecher</span>, preacher, orator,
lecturer, writer, editor, and reformer, was
born at Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1813.
He was by nature and training a great
pulpit orator. Mr. Beecher kept himself
in perfect physical condition for his work.
He has described a course of vocal exercises
which he pursued in the open air
for a period of three years. "The drill
I underwent," he says, "produced, not a
rhetorical manner, but a flexible instrument,
that accommodated itself readily to
every kind of thought and every shape
of feeling."</p>

<p>He had deep sympathy for all men, and
this with his intense dramatic power often
carried him into the wildest and most exalted
flights of oratory. Phillips Brooks
styled him the greatest preacher in
America, and he is generally regarded
as the most highly gifted of modern
preachers. He was fearless, patriotic,
clear-headed, witty, and self-sacrificing.
Dr. Wilkinson calls him "the greatest
pulpit orator the world ever saw." He
died in 1887.</p>

<h2>H. W. BEECHER</h2>

<h3>1813-1887</h3>

<h4>IMMORTALITY<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>

<p><em>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are
of all men most miserable.</em>&mdash;1 Cor. xv., 19.</p>


<p>This is not the declaration of a universal
principle: it is biographical and personal.
And yet, there is in it a principle
of prime importance. It is true that
Paul and his compeers had sacrificed everything
that was dear to man for the sake of
Christ. Paul had given up the place that he
held among his countrymen, and the things
which surely awaited him. He had consented
to be an exile. Loving Palestine and the
memory of his fathers, as only a Jew could
love, he found himself an outcast, and despised
everywhere by his own people. And
the catalog that he gives of the sufferings
which he felt keenly; which perhaps would
not have been felt by a man less susceptible
than he, but which were no less keen in his
case&mdash;that catalog shows how much he had
given up for Christ. And if it should turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
out that after all he had followed a mere
fable, a myth; that Christ was but a man;
that, dying, He had come to an end; that He
stayed dead, and that there was no resurrection,
no future, but only that past through
which he waded, and that present in which
he was suffering, then, surely, it would be
true that of all men he was most miserable.</p>

<p>This is the biographical view; but it may
be said of all men, in this respect, that no persons
can so ill afford to lose faith of immortality
as those who have had all their affections
burnished, deepened and rendered sensitive
by the power of Christianity. When
Christianity has had the education of generation
after generation, and has shaped the style
of its manhood, and ordained the institutions
by which its affections have been enlarged and
purified; when, in short, generations of men
have been legitimately the children of Christianity,
to take away from them the faith of
immortality would be a cruelty which could
have no parallel in the amount of suffering
which it would entail.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily true that men without
a hope of Christianity would have no incitement
to virtue&mdash;certainly not in the ordinary
way in which it is put to us. Abstractly, it
is said that virtue is its own reward&mdash;and it
is. If there was enough of it to amount to
anything, it would be a great, an exceeding
great, reward; but where it is a spark; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
germ; where it is struggling for its own existence;
where it bears but a few ripe fruits,
the reward is hardly worth the culture. If
all that we get is what we have in this life,
it is but little.</p>

<p>Many men are favorably organized and favorably
situated; they have an unyearning
content; things seem good enough for them;
and they do not understand why it is that
persons should desire immortality and glory&mdash;that
is, at first. In general, I think there
are few persons that live long in life who do
not, sooner or later, come to a point in which
they wake up to the consciousness of a need
of this kind. It is not always true in the case
of persons of refined moral and intellectual
culture that they are conscious of needing a
belief in immortality; but a belief in immortality
is the unavoidable result and the indispensable
requirement of all true manhood.
When you look at growth, not in each particular
case, but largely, as it develops itself
in communities; when you consider it, not
only in a single individual, but in whole communities,
as they develop from childhood to
manhood, or from barbarism through semi-civilization
to civilization and refinement, the
law of development is always away from animal
life and its sustaining appetites and passions
toward the moral and the intellectual.
That is the direction in which unfolding takes
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The naturalist watches the insect, and
studies all the stages through which it goes,
till it becomes a perfect insect. We look at a
seed, and see how it develops stem and leaf
and blossom all the way through, till we find
out what the plant is in its final and perfect
condition. And in studying men to know
what is the perfect condition of manhood,
looking at them from the beginning to the
end, which way does manhood lie, in the direction
of the bodily appetites and senses, or
in the other direction?</p>

<p>Men come into life perfect animals. There
is very little that culture does in that direction,
giving them a little more or a little less
use of themselves, as the case may be. That
which we mean when we speak of developing
manhood in a child, is something more than
the development of symmetry of form and
power of physical organization. When we
speak of the civilization and refinement of the
race at large, development does not mean bodily
power or bodily skill: it means reason;
moral sense; imagination; profounder affection;
subtler, purer, sweeter domestic relations.
Manhood grows away from bodily conditions,
without ever leaving them. The body
becomes a socket, and the soul is a lamp in it.
And if you look narrowly at what we mean by
growth in mankind, whether it be applied to
the individual or to the race, you will find
that we mean an unfolding which takes a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
away from the material toward that which is
subtler, more spiritual, existing outside of the
ordinary senses, tho acting from them, as
something better than bone and muscle, nerve
and tissue.</p>

<p>All development, then, is from the animal
toward the spiritual and the invisible. This
is the public sentiment of mankind even in
the lower forms of society. What are considered
heroic traits, the things which bring admiration
to men, if narrowly examined will
be found to be not the things which belong
to men as brutes&mdash;tho these things may be
employed by them as instruments. Even in
the cases of such men as Samson and Hercules,
who were rude, brute men, it was not
their strength that drew admiration to them:
it was their heroism; it was their patriotism;
it was that which they did by their strength
for their kind, and not for themselves. And
in lower societies it is courage, it is self-devotion,
it is the want of fear, it is the higher
form of animal life, that attracts admiration.
But as we develop out of barbarous into civilized
conditions, we admire men, not because
they can lift so much, or throw such heavy
weights, or endure such hardships of body.
Admiration on these accounts has its place;
but higher than these is the power of thought,
the power of planning, the power of executing,
the power of living at one point so as to
comprehend in the effects produced all circuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of time in the future. Thought-power;
emotion; moral sense; justice; equity in all
its forms; higher manhood, and its branches,
which stretch up into the atmosphere and
reach nearest to the sun&mdash;these are something
other than those qualities which develop earliest,
and are lowest&mdash;nearest to the ground.</p>

<p>True manhood, then, has its ripeness in the
higher faculties. Without disdaining the
companionship of the body the manhood of
man grows away from it&mdash;in another direction.
There is not simply the ripening of the physical
that is in man; but there is, by means of
the physical, the ripening of the intellectual,
the emotional, the moral, the esthetic life, as
well as the whole spiritual nature.</p>

<p>When reason and moral sense are developed,
there will inevitably spring up within a man
an element the value of which consists in
perpetuating things&mdash;in their continuance.
It is spontaneous and universal for one to
seek to perpetuate, to extend life. I do not
mean by this that one wants to live a great
while; but men are perpetually under the unconscious
influence of this in their nature: the
attempt to give form and permanence to that
which is best in their manhood. We build, to
be sure, primarily, to cover ourselves from the
elements; but we very soon cease to build for
that only: we not merely build for protection
from cold and from wet, but we build for
gratification. We build to gratify the sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of beauty, the sense of convenience, and the
sense of love. And we go on beyond that: we
build in order that we may send down to
those who are to come after us a memorial of
our embodied, incarnated thoughts. In other
words, when men build, they seek, by incarnation,
to render things permanent which have
existed only as thoughts or transient emotions.
There is a tendency to incarnate the fugitive
elements in men, and give them permanence.
And the element of continuing is one of the
elements which belong to the higher manhood.</p>

<p>This throws light upon the material growths
of society. Men strive to perpetuate thoughts
and feelings which are evanescent unless they
are born into matter. Men build things for
duration. There is this unconscious following
out of things to make them last; to give
them long periods. And it opens up to men
the sense of their augmented being. Largeness
of being is indissolubly connected with
extended time of being.</p>

<p>We admire the pyramids, not because they
have been associated with so many histories,
but because they have stood so many ages.
We admire old trees, not because so many
tribes have sat under them, nor because so
many events have taken place beneath them,
but simply because they have age with them.
For there are mute, inexplicable feelings connected
with the mere extension of time which
belong to the higher development of manhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in us. Frangible things are of less value than
things that are infrangible. Things that last
are of more value, on the same plane, than
their congeners are that do not last.</p>

<p>Who can equal the pictures which are
painted on the panes of glass in our winter
rooms? Where can you find a Lambineau, or
any painter who can give a mountain scenery
such as we have for nothing, every morning,
when we wake up, and such as the sun outside,
or the stove inside, destroys before ten
o'clock? These pictures are not valued as
are those which are painted on canvas, and
which are not half so good; but the element
of enduring is with the latter, while the element
of evanescence is with the former.
Tho the pictures on the pane are finer than
those on the canvas, they lack the element of
time, on which value so largely depends. The
soul craves, hungers for, this quality of continuance
as an element for measuring the
value of things. This element of time is somewhat
felt in the earlier conditions of humanity;
but it grows with the development of
men, and attaches itself to every part of human
life.</p>

<p>I never saw a diamond that was so beautiful
as are the dew-drops which I see on my
lawn in summer. What is the difference between
a dew-drop and a diamond? One goes
in a moment; it flashes and dies; but the
other endures; and its value consists in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
endurance. There are hundreds of things
which are as beautiful as a diamond in their
moment; but the endurance of the diamond
is measured by ages, and not by moments, and
so carries on the value.</p>

<p>I do not draw these reasonings very close
as yet&mdash;I do not desire to put too much emphasis
upon them; but I think you will see
that there is a drift in them, and that they will
bear, at last, an important relation to this
question of immortality. The element of
manhood carries with it a very powerful sense
of the value of existence. The desire to live
is a blind instinct. A happy experience brings
to this instinct many auxiliaries&mdash;the expectation
of pleasure; the wish to complete unfinished
things; the clinging affection to those
that have excited love; and habits of enterprise.</p>

<p>Besides all these, is a development of the
sense of value in simply being. We have said
that in external matters the continuity of
being is an element of value in the judgment
which mankind at large have put upon things.
We say that the same is true in respect to the
inward existence&mdash;to manhood itself. The
savage cares very little for life. He lives for
to-day; and in every to-day he lives for the
hour. Time is of the least importance to him.
The barbarian differs from the savage in this:
that he lives to-day for to-morrow, perhaps,
but not for next year. The semi-civilized man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
lives for next year; but only for the year, or
for years. The civilized man begins to live
in the present for the future. And the Christian
civilized man begins to live with a sense
of the forever.</p>

<p>The extension of the sense of time goes on
with the development of manhood in men. The
sweet, the tender, the loving, the thoughtful,
the intellectual, live not simply with a sense
of life as a pleasure-bringer: there grows up
in them, with their development toward manhood,
an intrinsic sense of the value of being
itself. The soul knows the cargo that it carries.
It knows that that cargo is destined to
immortality. As men are conscious of seeing
more, of thinking more, and of feeling more;
as thought becomes more precious; as emotion
becomes deeper and more valuable; so men
more and more feel that they cannot afford to
have such things go to waste.</p>

<p>A man who takes in his hands a lump of
mud and molds it to some pleasing form, cares
but little when, dropping it, he sees it flatten
on the ground. The man that grinds a crystal,
and sees it broken, thinks of it for a moment,
perhaps, with regret, but soon forgets
it. No one, however, can see an organized
thing, having its uses, and indicating exquisite
skill and long experience, dashed to pieces
without pain. But what is anything that is
organized in life worth in comparison with
the soul of a man? And if that soul be pure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and sweet, and deep, and noble, and active,
and fruitful, who can, without a pang, look
at it, and think that it must in an instant go
to nothing, dissolving again as an icicle from
a roof in the spring?</p>

<p>The feeling is not the fruit of mere reflection.
It is instinctive. It is universal. Men
do not cultivate it on purpose. They cannot
help having it. No man of moral culture can
regard human life as without immortality except
with profound melancholy. No man
that is susceptible to reflectiveness can bear
to think of man's existence here without the
bright background of another life.</p>

<p>The sense of the continuity of existence is
grounded in men, and grows with their refinement
and development and strength, and
gives color to their life, and change to their
opinions, it may be.</p>

<p>To men who have developed moral sense
and intellectual culture, every element of
value in life is made precious by some conscious
or some unconscious element of time
and continuance. It is the nature of our better
faculties, in their better states, to place a
man in such relations to everything that is
most precious to him, that it gives him pleasure
in the proportion in which it seems to be
continuous and permanent, and gives him
pain in the proportion in which it seems to
be evanescent and perishing.</p>

<p>We are building a crystal character with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
much pain and self-denial; and it is to be built
as bubbles are blown? What is finer in line
than the bubble? What is more airy? Where
are pictures more exquisite, where are colors
more tender and rich and beautiful&mdash;and
where is there anything that is born so near
to its end as a bubble? Is the character which
we are building with so much pain and suffering
and patience, with so much burden of
conscience, and with so much aspiration; is
the character which we are forming in the invisible
realm of the soul&mdash;is that but a bubble?
Is that only a thin film which reflects the
transient experiences of a life of joy or sadness,
and goes out? Then, what is life worth?
If I had no function but that of a pismire;
if I were a beetle that rolled in the dirt, and
yet were clothed with a power of reflection,
and knew what the depths of feeling were,
what intense emotions were, and what struggling
and yearning were; if, being a mere insect,
I had all the works in the intellect of
man, and all the aspiration that goes with
spiritual elements; if I were but a leaf-cutter,
a bug in the soil, or about the same thing on
a little larger pattern, and were to be blotted
out at death, what would be the use of my
trying to grow? If by refining and whetting
our faculties they become more susceptible
to pleasure, they become equally susceptible
to pain. And in this great, grinding, groaning
world, pain is altogether out of proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to pleasure, in an exquisite temperament.
The finer men are the better they are, if they
are forever; but the finer men are the worse
they are if they are only for a day; for they
have a disproportion of sensibility to suffering
over and above present remuneration and conscious
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Men feel an intrinsic sense of personality
and personal worth. They have self-esteem,
which is the only central, spinal, manly faculty
which gives them a sense of personal
identity and personal value, and which is an
auxiliary counselor of conscience itself. This
sense of "I" demands something more than
a short round of physical life, to be followed
by extinction. I am too valuable to perish so;
and every step in life has been training me
in the direction of greater value. As men
grow broader, and stronger, and finer, and
deeper, and sweeter, they become more and
more conscious of the intrinsic value of their
being, and demand for themselves a harbor
in order that they may not be wrecked or
foundered.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that there can be found, to
any considerable extent, or developed, friendships
which shall not, with all their strength
and with all their depth, resist the conception
of dissolution or of fading. For friendships
are not casual likings. Friendships are not
merely the interchange of good nature, and
the ordinary friendly offices of good neighborhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
These things are friendly, but they
do not comprise friendship. Two trees may
grow contiguous, and throw their shade one
over upon the other; but they never touch
nor help each other; and their roots quarrel
for the food that is in the ground. But two
vines, growing over a porch, meet each other,
and twine together, and twist fiber into fiber
and stem into stem, and take shape from each
other, and are substantially one. And such
are friendships. Now, one cannot have his
life divided as two trees are. He cannot enter
into partnership with others, and be conscious
that that partnership shall be but for an hour
or for a moment. The sanctity, the honor,
the exaltation, the exhilaration of a true and
manly friendship lies in the thought of its
continuance. There can be no deep friendship
which does not sign for endlessness.</p>

<p>Still more is this true of love: not that rudimentary
form which seeks lower fruitions, and
which is often but little more than passion
done up in friendship; but that higher love
which manifests itself chiefly in the spiritual
realm; that love which is not forever asking,
but forever giving; that love which is not
centripetal, but centrifugal; that love which,
like a mother's, gives for the pleasure of giving;
that love which reveres; that love which
looks up; that love which seeks to exalt its
object by doing what is pleasant and noble;
that love which demands continuance, elevation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
yea, grandeur, it may be, in the thing
beloved. How little will such a love tolerate
the idea of evanescence, the dread of discontinuing!
Can such a love do other than yearn
for immortality?</p>

<p>So then, if you take the thought, it is this:
that if men develop, they come under the dominion
of higher faculties; and that it is then
their nature to stamp on all their occupations,
on their self-consciousness, on the whole development
of their affections, the need of continuance,
of immortality. There are, therefore,
in the growth of the mind itself, as a
department of nature, these elements of conviction.
The mind cannot do other than develop
in itself a faith in immortality.</p>

<p>It may be said, and it sometimes is said,
that the origin of the belief of existence out
of the body, of spiritual existence, may be
traced directly back to the dreams of the barbarous
ages, to a period when men were so
low that they did not recognize the difference
between a dream and a waking reality&mdash;to a
time when persons dreamed that their friends
came back to them, and waked up and believed
that they had been back. Thus, it is
said, began the thought of continuity of life
after death. For my part, I do not care how
it began. The question is not how it started;
the question is, What becomes of it now that
it has begun? No matter how it was born,
what purpose is it to serve? What is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
adapted to do? How is it calculated to influence
our manhood? In what way shall it
be employed to lead man God-ward? How
shall it be used to work most effectually in
the direction of civilization and refinement?
It so fits every human soul, that men will
not let it go. They cling to it with their inward
and best nature.</p>

<p>All experiences of human life fall in with
this tendency of the mind. When men look
out upon the incoherent and unmannerly
course of things in time, I can understand
how, believing in the future, they may live
with patience; but in every age of the world
where the clear light of immortality has not
shone, men have mostly been discouraged,
have been generally indifferent to public superiority,
and have taken no interest in
things done for the sake of humanity. Such
is the worthlessness of time, to the thought of
those that have no faith in the future, that
they have cared for little except present physical
enjoyment. And on the whole, when such
men crowd together, and tribes take the place
of individuals, or kingdoms take the place
of tribes, with all their complications in the
working out of their clashing results, they
look upon human life, and feel that the world
is not worth living for. Things are so uncertain,
products are in such disproportion to
their causes, or to the expectations of men,
that if there is to be nothing but this life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
then, "Eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow
we die," is not only the philosophy
of the epicurean, but the temptation of the
most wise and frugal and self-restraining.
The nature of life to a man who is highly
educated requires that he should believe in
the continuity and existence of the myriads
that he sees in such a state of quarreling infelicity
and wretchedness in this mortal condition.
The utter futility of the best part
of man's life here, the total bankruptcy of
his best endeavors, the worthlessness of his
career from the material standpoint, makes
it imperative on him to believe that he shall
have another chance in another sphere of
being.</p>

<p>Is it enough to have been born, to have lived
till one is of age, and then to be launched out
to founder in mid-ocean? Is it enough that
one should devote the best part of his life to
the building of a character, only to see the
fabric which he has constructed tumbling
about his ears? Is this enough in the day of
distress and bankruptcy? Is it enough, in
the time when a man's ambitions are crossed,
and the sky is dark, and he can do nothing
but stand amid the ruins of his hopes and expectations?
Is not the thought revolting to
every instinct of manhood?</p>

<p>But if there is another life; if all our labor
has this value in it, that while a man is building
up his outward estate, if it is certain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the man himself will live, no matter what becomes
of his property and his reputation, then
all his endeavors have endless scope, and his
life becomes redeemable and radiant.</p>

<p>Nowhere else so much as in the realm of
grief, I think, is the question of immortality
interpreted. It is true that the first shock
of overwhelming grief sometimes drives faith
out of the mind; that it sometimes staggers
the reason; that it sometimes dispossesses the
moral sense of its accustomed health, and
leaves the mind in weakness. As in a fever,
the natural eye can see nothing aright, and
things then seem to dance in the air, and take
on grotesque forms, so persons who are bewildered
with first sorrow oftentimes see
things amiss. And there is no skepticism
which is so deep and pulseless as that which
often takes possession of people in the first
great overmastering surprize and shock of
grief. But after one had recovered a little,
and the nerve has come to its wonted sensibility,
the faith of immortality returns. There
is that in every soul which knows what is the
strength of life and noble deeds and aspirations;
and therefore there is that in every soul
which calls out for immortality.</p>

<p>I cannot believe, I will not believe, when I
walk upon the clod, that it is my mother that
I tread under foot. She that bore me, she
that every year more than gave birth to me
out of her own soul's aspiration&mdash;I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
believe that she is dust. Everything within
me revolts at the idea.</p>

<p>Do two persons walk together in an inseparable
union, mingling their brightest and
noblest thoughts, striving for the highest ideal,
like flowers that grow by the side of each
other, breathing fragrance each on the other,
and shining in beauty each for the other; are
two persons thus twined together and bound
together for life, until in some dark hour one
is called and the other is left; and does the
bleeding heart go down to the grave and say,
"I return dust to dust?" Was that dust,
then? That trustworthiness; that fidelity;
that frankness of truth; that transparent honesty;
that heroism of love; that disinterestedness;
that fitness and exquisiteness of taste;
that fervor of love; that aspiration; that
power of conviction; that piety; that great
hope in God&mdash;were all these elements in the
soul of the companion that had disappeared
but just so many phenomena of matter? And
have they already collapsed and gone, like last
year's flowers struck with frost, back again
to the mold? In the grief of such an hour
one will not let go the hope of resurrection.</p>

<p>Can a parent go back from the grave where
he has laid his children and say, "I shall
never see them more?" Even as far back as
the dim twilight in which David lived, he said,
"Thou shalt not come to me, but I shall go
to thee"; and is it possible for the parental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heart to stand in our day by the side of the
grave, where the children have been put out
of sight, and say, "They neither shall come
to me, nor shall I go to them; they are blossoms
that have fallen; they never shall bring
forth fruit"? It is unnatural. It is hideous.
Everything that is in man, every instinct that
is best in human nature repels it.</p>

<p>Is not the human soul, then, itself a witness
of the truth of immortality?</p>

<p>Men say, "You cannot prove it. There is
no argument that can establish it. No man
has seen it, and it cannot be substantiated. It
is not a ponderable thing." Men demand that
we should prove things by straight lines; by
the alembic; by scales; by analysis; but I say
that there is much in nature which is so high
that scales and rules and alembics cannot
touch it. And is not man's soul a part of
nature&mdash;the highest part?</p>

<p>I hold that even the materialist may believe
in immortality. For, altho there is a gross
kind of materialism, there may be a materialism
which is consistent with a belief in immortality.
Because, on the supposition that the
mind is matter, it must be admitted that it is
incomparably superior to any other matter
that we are familiar with. Is there any matter
outside of mind that produces thought and
feeling such as we see evolved among men?
If it be the theory that mind is matter, and if
the matter of which the mind is composed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
so far above all other kinds of matter in its
fruit and product, is it not on so high a plane
as presumably not to be subject to the lower
and coarser forms of examination and test?
I know no reason why cerebral matter may
not be eternal. I do not belong to those who
take that material view of the mind; but I
do not know that immortality is inconsistent
even with materialism; and how much more
easily may it be reconciled to the view of those
who believe in the ineffable character, the imponderable,
spiritual condition, of the soul!</p>

<p>In addition to these arguments, when we
come to the Word of God, we hear the voices
of those who sang and chanted in the past.
We hear the disciple crying out, "Christ is
risen!" and we hear the apostle preaching this
new truth to mankind. So that now the
heavens have been broken open. The secrets
of the other life have been revealed. And is
there not a presumption, following the line of
a man's best manhood, that immortality is
true? Does one need to go into a rigorous
logical examination of this subject? Should
one stand jealously at the side of the sepulcher
of Christ, and examine this matter as a policeman
examines the certificate of a suspected
man, or as one takes money from the hand of
a cheating usurer and goes out to see if it is
gold? Shall one stand at the door from which
issue all the hopes that belong to the best part
of man; shall one look upon that which is demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by the very nature of his better manhood,
and question it coldly, and tread it
under foot?</p>

<p>What do we gain by obliterating this fair
vision? Why should not heaven continue to
shine on? Why should we not look into it,
and believe that it is, and that it waits for
us? Have we not the foretokens of it? Is
not the analogy of the faculties one that leads
us to believe that there is some such thing?
Does not the nature of every man that is
high and noble revolt at flesh and matter?
Are they not rising toward the ineffable? Are
not all the intuitions and affections of men
such that, the better they are, the more they
have of things that are manly, the more indispensable
it is that they should have endurance,
etherealization, perpetuation?</p>

<p>The heart and flesh cry out for God. They
cry out for immortality. Not only does the
Spirit from the heavenly land say to every
toiling, yearning, anxious soul, "Come up
hither," but every soul that is striving upward
has in it, if not a vocalized aspiration,
yet a mute yearning&mdash;a voice of the soul&mdash;that
cries out for heaven,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God!"</p></blockquote>

<p>On such a day as this, then, in a community
of moral feeling, how blest is the truth
which comes to us, that we are not as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
beasts that die; that we are as the gods that
live! That for which we were made is immortality;
and our journey is rough, straight,
sharp, burdensome, with many tears. Our
journey is not to the grave. I am not growing
into old age to be blind, and to be deaf, and
to be rheumatic, and to shrink a miserable
cripple into the corner, shaking and tottering
and forgetting all that I ever knew. The best
part of me is untouched. The soul; the reason;
the moral sense; the power to think; the power
to will; the power to love; the power to admire
purity, and to reach out after it&mdash;that
is not touched by time, tho its instrument
and means of outer demonstration be corroded
and failing. No physical weakness touches
the soul. Only the body is touched by sickness.
And shake that down! Shake it down!
Let it go! For, as the chrysalis bursts open,
and the covering which confines the perfected
insect is dropt, that he may come out into
brightness of form and largeness of life, so
this body is but a chrysalis; and when we
break through it, we rise on wings by the attraction
of God, and by the propulsion of our
own inevitable desire and need, and are forever
with the Lord.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Edwin Hubbell Chapin</span>, Universalist
divine, was born in Union Village, Washington
County, N. Y., in 1814. He began
his very successful ministry 1837 in Richmond,
Va., subsequently he preached in
Charlestown, Mass., from which place he
was called to the pastorate of the Fourth
Universalist Church in New York City.
His preaching attracted large congregations,
and he was generally regarded as
one of the greatest preachers of this country.
He spoke from a manuscript, using
no gesture, but his magnetic personality
never failed to drive his message home. He
published numerous volumes of sermons
and lectures. He died in 1880.</p>

<h2>CHAPIN</h2>

<h3>1814-1880</h3>

<h4>NICODEMUS: THE SEEKER AFTER
RELIGION</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus,
a ruler of the Jews: The same came to Jesus by night.</em>&mdash;John
iii., 1, 2.</p></blockquote>


<p>Altho we have but few glimpses of
Nicodemus in the gospels, he is a personage
of peculiar interest. A Pharisee,
and a member of the great Jewish senate,
or Sanhedrin, he shows us that the influence of
Christ was not limited to the poor and the
obscure; but that, while His words and works
awoke enmity and fear among the higher
classes, they struck, in the breasts of some of
these, a holier chord.</p>

<p>It may not be certain that Nicodemus ever
openly confest Christ; yet, in this chapter,
he appears in the attitude of a disciple, and
we find him defending Jesus before the Sanhedrin,
and assisting at His burial. Still,
unless the last-mentioned act be considered as
such, we do not discover, in his conduct, that
public and decisive acknowledgment which the
Savior required; we do not behold the frank
avowal of Peter, or the intrepidity of Paul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
There is an air of caution and of timidity
about him. He carefully feels the ground of
innovation, before he lets go the establishment;
and, indeed, he appears to have taken
no step by which he forfeited his caste or his
office. It is difficult, too, to discover the
precise purpose of this visit to Jesus. Perhaps
he sought the interview from mixed
motives. A religious earnestness, kindled by
the teachings and the character of Christ, may
have blended with speculative curiosity, and
even with the throbbings of political ambition.
His coming by night, too, may have indicated
timidity, or he may have chosen that season as
the best time for quiet and uninterrupted
discourse. But, whatever may have been his
motives, the position in which we find him
shows, I repeat, that the power of Christ's
ministry was felt, not only by the excitable
multitude, but by the more thoughtful and
devout of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>Nicodemus, however, presents a peculiar
interest, not only because he exhibits the influence
of Jesus upon the higher orders of his
nation, but because he appears as a seeker
after religion, and as one personally interested
in its vital truths. His interview with the
Savior gives occasion for one of the most
important passages in the New Testament.
The conversation of Christ, in this instance,
is not uttered in general principles and accommodated
to the multitude, but it is directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
an intelligent and inquiring spirit, in the calm
privacy of the night-time laying bare its very
depths, and craving the application of religion
to its own peculiar wants. To be sure, Nicodemus
did not profess this want, but commenced
the conversation with the language of
respect, and with suggestion of more general
inquiry. But He who "knew what was in
man," had already penetrated the folds of the
ruler's breast, and saw the real need that had
sent him; so, putting by all compliments, and
all secondary issues, He struck at once the
conscious chord that throbbed there, and exclaimed:
"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God!" These words must have
filled Nicodemus with surprize, both from
their sudden heart-searchingness, and as addressing
to him a term which was usually
applied to men of very different condition.
For the phrase, "new birth," was a customary
one to express the change through which the
Gentile passed in becoming a Jew. But it was
indeed a strange doctrine that he, a son of
Abraham, a Pharisee, a ruler, must be born
again, before he could be fit for the Messiah's
kingdom. Therefore, really or affectedly, he
misunderstood the Savior's words, and gave to
a phrase, plain enough when applied to a
heathen, the most gross and literal interpretation.
But Christ reiterated the solemn truth
assuring him that an inward change, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
outward profession, a regeneration of the affections
and the will, and a renunciation of
pride and fear, by the symbol of baptism&mdash;a
new birth of water and of the Spirit&mdash;was
essential to true discipleship. And thus, stripping
away all the reliances of formal righteousness,
and all the supports of birth and
position, in reply to the earnest question of
Nicodemus: "How can these things be?" the
great Teacher proceeded to utter some of the
sublimest doctrines of the gospel.</p>

<p>As I have already said, whether Nicodemus
became an avowed follower of Jesus, or not,
is uncertain; but we know that the truths
which he then heard are of everlasting importance,
have a personal application to every
man, and appeal to wants in our own souls,
which are as real and as deep as those of the
ruler of old.</p>

<p>But while thus Nicodemus exhibits a need of
our common humanity, he especially represents
a class who may be called "seekers after
religion," either as being unsettled and inquiring
in their spirits, or as resting upon
something which is not religion, but only,
perhaps, a tendency toward it&mdash;they are seekers
after it, as not having actually found it.
In other words, for this class, religion has its
meaning and its pressure; they think about it,
and they feel its claims, yet they do not
thoroughly and mentally know it; or, like
Nicodemus, they rest upon some substitute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Some of these positions I propose now to
illustrate.</p>

<p>I observe, then, in the first place, that some
seek religion in rituals and sacraments. The
tendency of the human mind, as to matters
of faith and devotion, has always been to complicate
rather than to simplify, and to associate
these with set forms and symbols. In all
ages, men have shrunk from naked communion
with God, from the solitude of an intense
spirituality, and have conducted transactions
with the Invisible, through the mediation
of ceremony. But that which, at first,
was an expression of the individual soul, has
grown into a fixed and consecrated rite.
Gestures and modes of worship, suggested by
the occasion, have been repeated in usage, and
grown venerable with age, until they have
become identified with religion itself. They
have been exalted into mystic vehicles of
grace, have been considered as possessing
virtue in themselves, and as constituting an
awful paraphernalia, through which, alone,
God will deign to communicate with man, and
through which man may even propitiate and
move God. Christianity has not escaped this
tendency; and, even now, there are many
with whom the sacraments are something more
than expressive signs and holy suggestions,
and with whom the position of an altar, the
shape of a vestment, and the form of a church
are among the essentials of religion. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
such, baptism speaks, not merely to the eye
of an inward washing, but it is of itself a
regenerative process. In their view, the communion
bread is not simply a representation
of the broken body of the Redeemer; but is
itself so sacred, so identical with that body,
that they must receive it by a special posture,
and upon a particular part of the hand. As a
matter of course, to such, religion must appear
eminently conservative and retrospective; the
genius of the established and the past, rather
than of the reformatory and the future.
Cherishing the minutest fibers of these ancient
rites, they chiefly venerate the men who
authenticate them, and the soil out of which
they grow. With them, the fluent spirit of
religion became organized, and fixt into a form,
with fast-days and feast-days, with miter and
cassock, and a lineal priesthood, ages ago.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that this method is entirely
unfounded. It has its justification in human
nature, if not elsewhere. There are those who
can find peace only in the arms of an hereditary
faith: who can feel the inspiration of
worship only among forms that have kindled
worship in others for a thousand years: with
whose earliest thoughts and dearest memories
is entwined a ritual and an established
church, so that personal affection and household
sanctity, as well as religious feeling, demand
that every great act of life&mdash;of joy or
sorrow&mdash;should be consecrated, by the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sacrament. For that church, too, their
fathers have died in darker times, and beneath
its chancels, sainted mothers molder into
dust. All, too, that can exalt the ideal, or
wake the pulses of eloquent emotion, is connected
with such a church. To them it opens
a traditional perspective, the grandest in all
history. Behind its altars, sweep the vestments
of centuries of priests, and rises the
incense of centuries of prayer. In its stony
niches, stand rows of saints, who have made
human life sublime, and who, through all the
passing ages, look down upon the turmoil of
that life with the calm beatitude of heaven;
while its flushed windows still keep the blood-stain
of its own martyrs, plashed against it
ere yet it had become an anchored fact, and
while it tossed upon the stormy waves of
persecution. I can understand, then, how an
imaginative and reverential mind can find the
truest religious life only in connection with
ritual and sacrament.</p>

<p>I can understand, moreover, the reaction in
this direction, which is taking place at the
present day.</p>

<p>It is the retreat of the religious sentiments
from the despotism of an imperious reason.
It is the counter-protest of loyal affections
against what is deemed an anarchical tendency.
It is the clinging of men's sympathies
to the concrete, alarmed by the irreverent and
analytic methods of science. It is the retirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of faith and devotion to those cloistered
sanctities that shut out the noise of the populace,
and the diversions of the street. It is the
reluctance of taste and imagination at our new
and varnished Protestantism, with its bare
walls, its cold services, and its angular
churches, of which one wing, perchance, rests
upon a market, and the other upon a dram-shop.
Especially would I not deny the profound
spiritual life, the self-sacrifice, and the
beautiful charities which have consisted at all
times, and which consist in the present time,
with this ritual and sacramental form of
religion.</p>

<p>But when men claim that this alone is the
genuine form&mdash;that these are essentials of the
only true Church&mdash;then I deny that claim.
If it fills some wants of our nature, it repudiates
others equally authentic. If one class of
minds find peace only under its consecrated
shadows, others find no satisfaction but in the
discipline of a spontaneous devotion, and the
exercise of an individual reason. If it suffices
for men like Borromeo or Newman, it does not
suffice for men like George Fox or Channing;
and the religion of these is as evident, in their
simple spirituality, as those in their mystic
symbolism. When it sneers at the Puritan,
then I must vindicate that rugged independence
of soul, that faithfulness of the individual
conscience, that sense of the divine
sovereignty, which could kneel at no man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
altar, and to God alone; which sacrificed all
things for the right, but yielded not a hair to
the wrong; which could find no medicine for
the spirit in sacraments, but only in the solitude
of the inner life; and which has, under
God, wrought out this noble consummation of
modern times, whereby others may plant their
vine of ritual under the broad heaven of
toleration, and have liberty to sneer. When
the ritualist deprecates the ultraism and
irreverence of the anti-formalist, I must urge
the tendency of his own principles to mummery
and absolutism. And, finally, when he
falls back upon tradition, I must fall back
upon the Bible. The spirit of the New Testament
is not that of rituals or sacraments; and
the universal sentiments of the Old are not.
The prophet Isaiah, who exclaims: "Bring no
more vain oblations; incense is an abomination
unto me; your new moons, and your appointed
feasts, my soul hateth.... Wash
you, make you clean ... cease to do evil,
learn to do well!" joins with the apostle, who
says that Christ "blotted out the handwriting
of ordinances ... nailing it to his cross,"
and that no man should judge us in meat or
drink, or times, or seasons. And surely, there
is no argument for forms or places in those
Divine Words, which declare that "God is a
Spirit, and they who worship him, must
worship him in spirit and in truth."</p>

<p>We cannot deny, then, that pure religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
may consist with rituals and sacraments; we
cannot deny that it may exist without these.
But I insist upon this point: that the sacrament,
the ritual, is not, itself, religion. It may
be a beautiful sign&mdash;it may be a quick suggestion&mdash;it
may be a medium of spiritual
influence; but, alone, it cannot take the place
of inward, personal piety, of right affections
and an obedient will. No punctilious form
can stand substitute for a vigilant conscience;
no posture of devotion can supply the place
of living deeds; no ascetic mortification can
atone for guilt; no auricular confession can
speak, instead of the breathings of repentance,
in the ear of God, and out from the depths
of the solitary soul. He who relies upon these
forms, and finds sanctity only in them, may be
sincere, may be serious about religion, but as
yet he is only a seeker; and, speaking to his
heart with all-penetrating meaning, comes to
him the decree: "Ye must be born again."</p>

<p>Again; there is a class who seek religion in
philosophy. They believe in God by a course
of reasoning. They believe in immortality,
because it is a conclusion riveted in their
minds by the iron links of induction. They
pray, or not, according as it seems logical to
do so. They would be good, because goodness
is useful.</p>

<p>But every proposition upon which they act,
must first be strained through the alembic of
the intellect, and must stand out in the clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
definition of science. They verify and build
up their religion with callipers and dissecting-knife.
It is a system of digestion and pneumatology.
They find an organ for veneration,
and another for conscientiousness, and therefore
conclude that religion has a legitimate
place in the harmony of human character.
But all must be calm and balanced. They
dare not trust the feelings and give but little
scope to enthusiasm. Sometimes, indeed, they
rise to eloquence in expatiating upon the
truths of natural theology, and of "the elder
Scripture"; tho they believe in Christ also,
because He seems well authenticated as an
historical fact. In short, such men are religious
like Cicero, or Seneca, with some modification
from modern science and from the
Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>Now there is a close alliance between true
philosophy and true religion. That the New
Testament is eminently free from fanaticism,
and makes no appeal to mere credulity, any
one will see who examines. That it is rational
and sober, constitutes one of its great internal
evidences. A Christian philosopher is no
anomaly, but a beautiful expression of the
essential harmony of all truth. Knowledge
and piety burn and brighten with an undivided
flame. Revelation and science are continually
interpreting one another, while every
day the material universe is unfolding a more
spiritual significance, and indicating its subservience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to a spiritual end. But, after all,
in order to be religious, it is not necessary
that a man should be a philosopher, and it is
certain that often he is a philosopher without
being religious. Religion and philosophy may
coalesce, but they are two different spheres.
Philosophy is out-looking and speculative;
religion is inner and vital. In the scheme of
philosophy, religion is reasoned out as a consequence,
and adopted as an appendage to character.
In the true scheme, it is the central
germ of our being, the controlling force of
life. The religion of philosophy consists of
right views of things, and a prudential schooling
of the passions. True religion consists in a
right state of the affections, and a renunciation
of self. In the one case, religion may "play
round the head, but come not near the heart";
in the other, it breaks up the great deep of
conscience, and pours an intense light upon
the springs of motive. Philosophy contains
the idea of intellectual rectitude; religion, of
moral obedience. Philosophy speaks of virtue;
religion, of holiness. Philosophy rests
upon development; religion requires regeneration.
In short, we make an every-day distinction
between the two which is far more significant
than any verbal contrast. It is the one,
rather than the other, that we apply, in the
profounder experiences of our moral nature,
in the consciousness of sin and in the overwhelming
calamities of life. The one pours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a purifying, healing, uplifting power into the
homes of human suffering, and into the hearts
of the ignorant and the poor, that the other
has not to bestow. Philosophy is well under
all circumstances; but it is not the most inner
element of our humanity. Religion, in its
humility, penitence, and faith&mdash;at the foot of
the cross, and by the open sepulcher&mdash;rejoices
in a direct and practical vision, to which
philosophy, with its encyclopedia and telescope,
cannot attain.</p>

<p>Under this head, too, may be ranked a class
of men who, tho they may not be exactly
philosophers, fall into the same conception of
religion, as a matter of the intellect&mdash;as the
possession of correct views&mdash;rather than a profound
moral life. They estimate men according
to what they believe, and attribute the
same sanctity to the creed that others attribute
to the ritual. And as religion, in their conception
of it, consists in a series of correct
opinions, the great work should be an endeavor
to make men think right. So the
pulpit should be an arsenal of controversial
forces, incessantly playing upon the ramparts
of dogmatic error, with the artillery of dogmatic
truth, and forever hammering the same
doctrinal monotony upon the anvils of logic
and of textual interpretation. They are satisfied
if some favorite tenet is proved to a
demonstration, and go forth rejoicing in the
superiority of their "views," without asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
if saving love has melted and transfigured
their own hearts, or whether personal sin may
not canker in their souls, if hereditary guilt is
not there. Now, it is true that great principles
lie at the foundation of all practical life,
and the more elevated and clear our views,
the more effectual are the motives to holiness
and love.</p>

<p>But it matters little to what pole of doctrine
the intellect swings, if the heart hangs unpenetrated
and untouched. It matters little to
what opinions in theology the pulpit has made
converts, if all its mighty truths have not
heaved the moral nature of the hearer&mdash;if it
has not shot into the individual soul, like an
arrow, the keen conviction: "I must be born
again!"</p>

<p>Once again: there are those who seek
religion in a routine of outward and commendable
deeds&mdash;in mere morality. With
such, the great sum of life is to be sober,
chaste, humane; laying particular stress upon
the business virtues, honesty, industry, and
prudence. In their idea, that man is a religious
man who is an upright dealer, an
orderly citizen, a good neighbor, and a charitable
giver. To be religious, means to do good,
to keep your promises, and mind your own
business. They tell us that benevolence is the
richest offering, and that the truest worship
is in the workshop and the field&mdash;that a man
prays when he drives a nail or plows a furrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and that he expresses the best thanksgiving
when he enjoys what he has got, and is content
if he gets no more.</p>

<p>Now, the world is not so bad that there is
not a good deal of this kind of religion in it.
It would be unjust to deny that many golden
threads of integrity wind through the fabric
of labor; that there is a strong nerve of rectitude
holding together the transactions of daily
life, and a wealth of spontaneous kindness
enriching its darker and more terrible scenes.</p>

<p>But, after all, these easy sympathies, and
these prudential virtues, lack the radicalness
of true religion. Religion cannot exist without
morality; but there is a formal morality
which exists without religion. I say, a formal
morality; for essential morality and essential
religion are as inseparable as the sap and the
fruit. Nor is morality a mere segment of
religion. It is one-half of it. Nay, when we
get at absolute definitions, the two terms may
be used interchangeably; for then we consider
religion presenting its earthly and social
phase, and we consider morality with its axis
turned heavenward. But, in the case of these
outside virtues, which are so common, we behold
only one-half of religion, and that is its
earthly and social form; and even this lacks
the root and sanction of true morality. For
the difference between the morality of a religious
man and that of another, consists in
this: with the one, morality bears the sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of an absolute law, and God is at its center.
It is wrought out by discipline, and maintained
at all cost. With the other, it is an
affair of temperament, and education, and
social position. He has received it as a
custom, and adopted it as a policy; or he
acts upon it as an impulse. With the one,
it is a matter of profit and loss, or a fitful
whim of sentiment. With the other, it is
the voice of a divine oracle within, that must
be obeyed; it is the consecrated method of
duty, and the inspiration of prayer. Now, to
say that it makes no difference about the
motive of an act, so long as the act itself is
good, indicates that very lack of right feeling
and right perception, which confounds the
formal morality of the world with religion.
For, in the distinctions of the Christian system,
the motive makes the deed good or bad; makes
the two mites richer than all the rest of the
money in the treasury; makes the man who
hates his brother a murderer. The good action
may bless others, but if I do not perform it
from a right motive, it does not bless me; and
the essential peculiarity of religion is, that it
regards inward development, individual purity,
personal holiness&mdash;so that one essential
excellence of the good deed consists in its
effect upon the agent&mdash;consists in the sinews
which it lends to his moral power, and the
quantity it adds to his spiritual life. When,
from a right motive, with effort and sacrifice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I help a weak and poor man, I enrich my individual
and spiritual being. If I bestow from
a mere gush of feeling, I receive no permanent
spiritual benefit; if from a bad motive, I
impoverish my own heart. Acts, then, which
appear the same thing in form, differ widely,
considered in the religious bearings. There is
the morality of impulse, the morality of
selfishness, and the morality of principle, or
religious morality. The motive of the first-named,
we obey instantaneously, and it may
do good, just as we draw our hands from the
flame, and thereby obey a law of our physical
nature, tho we act without any consideration
of that law. A great deal of the morality in
the world is of this kind.</p>

<p>It may do good, but has no reference to
the law of rectitude. It is impulsive, and,
therefore, does not indicate a steadfast virtue,
or a deep religious life. For the very impulsiveness
that leads to the gratification of
the sympathies, leads to the gratification of
the appetites, and thus we often find generous
and benevolent characteristics mixed with
vicious conduct. Then, as I have said, there
is the morality of selfishness. In this instance,
I may perform many good actions from sheer
calculation of material profit. I may be benevolent,
because it will increase my reputation
for philanthropy. I may be honest, because
"honesty is the best policy." But is this
the highest, the religious sanction of morality?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
No; the morality of the religious man is the
morality of principle. The motive in his case
is not "I will," or "I had better," but "I
ought." He recognizes morality as a law,
impersonal, overmastering the dictates of
mere self, and holding all impulses in subservience
to the highest good. The morality
of impulse is uncertain. The morality of
policy is mean and selfish. The morality of
religion is loyal, disinterested, self-sacrificing.
It acts from faith in God, and with reference
to God.</p>

<p>But another trait separates the religious
from the merely formal moralist. It consists
in the fact that with him, "morality," as we
commonly employ the term, is not all. Piety
has its place. His affections not only flow
earthward, but turn heavenward. He not only
loves his neighbor as himself, but he loves the
Lord, his God. He not only visits the widows
and the fatherless in their affliction, but he
keeps himself unspotted from the world.
With him, toil is prayer, and contentment is
thanksgiving, because he infuses into them
a spirit of devotion, which he has cultivated
by more solitary and special acts. With him
it is a good thing to live honestly, industriously,
soberly; but all life is not outward, is
not in traffic and labor, and meat and drink.
There is an inward world, to which his eyes
are often introverted&mdash;a world of spiritual
experience, of great realities, and everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sanctions&mdash;a world behind the veil&mdash;a holy of
holies in his soul, where rests the Shekinah of
God's more immediate presence; yea, where
he meets God face to face. And it is this that
directs his public conduct. The orderly and
beautiful method of his life is not the huddled
chance-work of good impulses, is not the
arithmetic of selfishness; but it is a serene
and steady plan of being projected from the
communion of the oratory, and the meditation
of the closet.</p>

<p>Again, I say, let us not depreciate morality.
Let us condemn that ostentatious piety which
lifts up holy hands to God, but never stretches
them out to help man; which anoints its head
with the oil of sanctity, but will not defile its
robes with the blood of the abused, or the contact
of the guilty; which is loud in profession
and poor in performance; which makes long
prayers, but devours widow's houses. Let us
condemn this, but remember that this is not
real religion, only its form; as often, the kind
deed, the honest method, is not true morality,
only its form. Of both these departments of
action let it be said: that these we have done,
and not left the other undone. Let us recognize
the perfect harmony, nay, the identity of
religion and morality, in that One who came
from the solitary conflict of the desert, to go
about doing good, and who descended, from
the night prayer on the mountain, to walk
and calm the troubled waves of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>But those who rest in a mere routine of kind
and prudential deeds need the deeper life
and the inner perception which detects the
meaning and gives the sanction to those deeds.
Such need the vital germ of morality&mdash;the
changed heart, the new birth.</p>

<p>And as I have spoken of a subordinate yet
somewhat distinct class who may be ranked
under the general head of seekers after
religion in philosophy, let me here briefly
allude to some with whom religion is a matter
of mere sentiment and good feeling. Such are
easily moved by the great doctrines of the
New Testament. They are affected by the
sermon; they have gushes of devout emotion
during the prayer. But with them, religion
is not a deep and steady pulse of divine life.
Prayer is not a protracted aspiration&mdash;is not
a habit. They feel well towards God, because
they consider Him a good-natured, complacent
being; but they do not meditate upon the
majesty of His nature, upon His justice, and
His holiness.</p>

<p>From the doctrine of immortality they draw
consolation, but not sanctity. They regard it
as a good time coming, but it furnishes them
with no personal and stringent applications
for the present. They need a more solemn and
penetrating vision; a profounder experience
in the soul. They need to be born again.</p>

<p>Then, again, there are those who may be
called amateurs in religion. That is they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
curious about religious things. They like to
speculate about it, to argue upon its doctrines
and to broach or examine new theories. They
go about from sect to sect, and from church
to church, tasting what is novel in the reasoning,
or pleasing in the manner of the
preacher; in one place to-day to hear an
orator; in another to-morrow to hear a latter-day
saint; it is all the same thing to them. All
they want with religion is entertainment and
excitement. They are Athenians, ever seeking
some new thing. They smack at a fresh
heresy as if they were opening a box of figs,
and are as delighted with a controversy, as
a boy with a sham-fight. They have no fixt
place in the Church universal. They are
liberalists, without any serious convictions,
and cosmopolites without any home affections.
In fact, to them religion is a sham-fight&mdash;a
matter of spectacle and zest&mdash;not a personal
interest, or an inward life. They would seek
Jesus by night, because they hope to learn
something wonderful or new, and would be
started to hear His solemn words tingling in
their hearts: "Ye must be born again!"</p>

<p>Nay, my friends, would not these solemn
words startle many of us? It may be, we
have never made any inquiry concerning religion&mdash;have
never even come to Jesus, as it
were, by night. Such, with their barks of
being drifting down the stream of time, have
never guessed the meaning of their voyage, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
reckoned their course; nay, perhaps they
live as tho religion were a fable, as tho
earth were our permanent abiding-place, and
heaven a dream. If such there are, they have
not even listened to the Savior's words. But
there are others among us perhaps, who are
interested in the subject of religion, who are in
some way or another engaged in it; but who
are restless seekers after it, rather than actual
possessors of it; who are resting upon insufficient
substitutes for it. And I ask, would not
these words breaking forth from the lips of
Jesus, startle us in our ritualism, our philosophy,
our outside morality, our sentimentalism,
or our mere curiosity? And do they not speak
to us? Are they not as true now as when they
struck upon the shivering ear of Nicodemus?
Do they not make us feel as intensely our
obligation and our religious wants, as he might
have felt there, with the wind flitting by him
as tho the Holy Spirit were touching him with
its appeal, and with the calm gaze of the
Savior looking into his heart? Do they not
demand of us, resting here awhile from the
cares and labors of the world, something more
than mere conformity, or intellectual belief,
or formal deeds? Do they not demand a new
and better spirit, a personal apprehension of
the religious life, a breaking up and regeneration
of our moral nature, a change of heart?</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Arthur Penrhyn Stanley</span>, the English
scholar and divine, was born 1815 at
Alderley, of which his father was rector.
He was educated under Dr. Arnold at
Rugby and in 1834 began a brilliant
career at Oxford. Having been ordained
priest in 1843 he was made Canon of
Canterbury in 1851 and Dean of Westminster
in 1864. At this date began his
career as an ethical preacher. His pulpit
became the means of reconciling many to
the English Church because of its broad
and sympathetic feeling of Christian
brotherhood. All of his discourses are
marked by a refined literary culture and
a catholicity of spirit. Stanley's most
famous sermons are those in which he
celebrates the life and work of many
illustrious men who had passed away
during his lifetime. He died in 1881.</p>

<h2>STANLEY</h2>

<h3>1815-1881</h3>

<h4>IN MEMORIAM&mdash;THOMAS CARLYLE</h4>

<p><em>The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which
sowed good seed in his field.</em>&mdash;Matt. xiii., 24.</p>


<p>The gospel of this day starts with a comparison
of the kingdom of heaven to a
sower. It is the same as that with
which the more celebrated parable begins, "A
sower went forth to sow." They both fix
our minds on the manner in which God's kingdom&mdash;the
kingdom of truth, beauty and goodness&mdash;is
carried on in the world. The kingdom
of all that is good is fostered, not so much
by direct and immediate plantation or grafting
or building or formations of any kind,
but rather by the sowing of good seed, which,
in time, shall grow up and furnish a rich
harvest.</p>

<p>It is so with regard to the truths of the
Bible. They are sown in the world; the good
which grows up after them is never, in outward
form, like the truth which came from
the actual source. Institutions spring up.
They may derive their vitality from the corn
and wheat which sink into the ground; but
they cannot be the very thing itself. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
is not a single form, or a single doctrine of
Christendom, of which the outward shape is
not different, in some way, from the principle
of life which gave it birth.</p>

<p>There is only one instance of a ready-made
scholastic doctrine in the whole Bible, and
that has been long known to be spurious. It
is not the verse of the three witnesses, but the
parable of the Good Shepherd, the poetry of
the Prodigal Son, the pathetic story of the
Crucifixion, that have been the true seeds of
the Christian life. In this way it is that the
divine origin of these truths proves itself.
The bright and tender words can never grow
old, because they are not flowers cut and
dried, but seeds and roots, which are capable
of bearing a thousand applications.</p>

<p>Again, this is the ground of our looking
forward with a hope, which nothing can extinguish,
toward the transformation, the renewal
of the human life, for a moment perishing,
to reappear, we trust, in some future
world, instinct with the capacities for good
or evil with which it was endowed, or which
it has acquired in the life that now is. The
seminal form within the deeps of that little
chaos sleeps, which will, we trust, in the almighty
providence of God, restore that chaos
of decayed and broken powers into conditions
more elevated than now we can dream of.</p>

<p>Again, characters appear in the world
which have a vivifying and regenerating effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
not so much for the sake of what they
teach us, as for the sake of showing us how
to think and how to act. What Socrates
taught, concerning man and the universe, has
long since passed away; but what he taught
of the method and process of pursuing truth&mdash;the
inquiry, the cross-examination, the sifting
of what we do know from what we do not
know&mdash;this is the foundation of the good seed
of European philosophy for all time. What
St. Paul taught concerning circumcision and
election or grace is among the things hard to
be understood, which the unlearned and the
unstable may wrest to their own destruction,
or, having served their generation, may be
laid asleep; but what he taught of the mode
and manner of arriving at divine truth, when
he showed how "the letter killeth and the
spirit maketh alive"; when he set forth how
charity is the bond of all perfectness; when
he showed how all men are acceptable to God
by fulfilling, each in his vocation, whether
Jew or Gentile, whether slave or free, the commandments
of God&mdash;he laid the true foundation
of Christian faith; he planted in the
heart of man the seed, the good seed, of Christian
liberty and Christian duty, to bear fruit
again and again amidst the many relapses and
eclipses of Christendom. When Luther dinned
into the ears of his generation the formula
of transubstantiation and of justification by
faith only, this was doomed to perish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"wax old as doth a garment"; but his acts,
his utterances of indignant conscience and
of far-sighted genius, became the seed of the
Reformation, the hope of the world. When
John Wesley rang the changes of the well-known
formula of assurance, it was the word
of the ordinary preacher; but, in his whole
career of fifty years of testifying for holiness
and preaching against vice, this was the seed
of more than Methodism&mdash;it was the seed of
the revival of English religious zeal. Such
seeds, such principles, such infusions, not of
a mechanical system, but of a new light in the
world, are not of every-day occurrence&mdash;they
are the work of a few, of a gifted few, and,
therefore, are so much the more to be observed
when anyone, who has had it in his power to
scatter such seeds right and left, passes away
and leaves us to ask what we have gained,
what we can assimilate, of the peculiar nourishment
which his life and teachings may have
left for our advantage. Few will doubt that
such an one was he who yesterday was taken
from us. It may be that he will not be laid,
as might have been expected, among the poets
and scholars and sages, whose dust rests
within this Abbey; it may be that he was
drawn by an irresistible longing toward the
native hills of his own Dumfriesshire, and that
there, beside the bones of his kindred, beside
his father and his mother, and with the silent
ministrations of the Church of Scotland, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which he still clung amidst all the vicissitudes
of his long existence, will repose all that is
earthly of Thomas Carlyle. But he belonged
to a wider sphere than Scotland; for, tho by
nationality a Scotchman, he yet was loved and
honored wherever the British language is
spoken. Suffer me, then, to say a few words
on the good seed which he has sown in our
hearts.</p>

<p>In his teaching, as in all things human,
there were, no doubt, tares, or what some
would account tares, which must be left to
after-times to adjust, as best they can, with
the pure wheat which is gathered into the
garner of God. There were imitators, parasites,
exaggerators, of the genuine growth,
which sometimes almost choked the original
seed and disfigured its usefulness and its
value; but of this we do not speak here.
Gather them up into bundles and burn them.
We speak only of him and of his best self.
Nor would we now discourse at length on
those brilliant gifts which gave such a charm
to his writings, and such an unexampled
splendor to his conversation. All the world
knows how the words and the deeds of former
times became, as Luther describes in the
apostle's language, "not dead things, but living
creatures with hands and feet." Every
detail was presented before us, penetrated
through and through with the fire of poetic
imagination, which was the more powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
because it derived its warmth from facts gathered
together by the most untiring industry.
Who can ever, from this time forward, picture
the death of Louis XVI, or the flight of the
king and queen, without remembering the
thrill of emotion with which, through the
"History of the French Revolution," they became
acquainted with him for the first time?
Who can wander among the ruins of St. Edmunds's
at Bury without feeling that they are
haunted in every corner by the lifelike figure
of the Abbot Samson, as he is drawn from the
musty chronicle of Jocelyn? Who can read
the letters and the speeches of Cromwell, now
made almost intelligible to modern years,
without gratitude to the unwearied zeal which
gathered together from every corner those
relics of departed greatness? What German
can fail to acknowledge that, not even in that
much-enduring, all-exhausting, country of research
and labor&mdash;not even there has there
been raised such a monument to Frederick the
Second, called the Great, as by the simple
Scotchman who, for the sake of describing
what he considered the last hero-king, almost
made himself, for the time, a soldier and a
statesman?</p>

<p>But, on these and many like topics, this is
not the time or place to speak. It is for us
to ask, as I have said, What was the good seed
which he sowed in the field of our hearts, and
in what respects we shall be, or ought to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the better for the sower having lived and died
among us?</p>

<p>It was customary for those who honored
him to speak of him as a prophet. And, if
we take the word in its largest sense, he truly
deserved the name. He was a prophet, in
the midst of an untoward generation: his
prophet's mantle was his rough Scotch dialect,
and his own peculiar diction, and his own
secluded manner of life. He was a prophet,
most of all, in the emphatic utterance of
truth which no one else, or hardly anyone
else, ventured to deliver, and which, he felt,
was a message of good to a world which sorely
needed them. He stood almost alone, among
the men of his time, in opposing a stern, inflexible
resistance to the whole drift and pressure
of modern days toward exalting popular
opinion and popular movements as oracles to
be valued above the judgment of the few,
above the judgment of the wise, the strong,
and the good. Statesmen, men of letters,
preachers, have all bowed their heads under
the yoke of this, as they believed, irresistible
domination, under the impression that the
first duty of the chiefest man is, not to lead,
but to be led&mdash;the necessary conditions of success,
to ascertain which way the current flows,
and to swim with it as far as it will bear us.
To his mind all this proved an insane delusion.
That expression of his, which has become,
like many of his expressions, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
proverbial in the minds of those who like them
least, will express the attitude of his mind,
his answer to the question, "What are the
people of England?" "Thirty millions&mdash;mostly
fools." The whole framework and
fabric of his mind was built up on the belief
that there are not many wise, not many noble
minds, not many destined by the supreme
Ruler of the universe to rule their fellows;
that few are chosen; that "strait is the gate
and narrow is the way, and few there be that
find it." But, when the few appear, when
the great and good present themselves it is
the duty and the wisdom of the multitude to
seek their guidance. A Luther, a Cromwell,
a Goethe, were to him the born kings of men.
This was his doctrine of the work of heroes;
this, right or wrong, was the mission of his
life. It is, all things considered, a fact much
to be meditated upon; it is, all things considered,
a seed which is worthy of all cultivation.</p>

<p>There is another feeling of the age to which he
also stood resolutely opposed, or, rather, a feeling
of the age which was resolutely opposed to
him, the tendency to divide men into two hostile
camps, parted from each other by watchwords
and flags, and banners and tokens, which we
commonly designate by the name of party. He,
perchance, disparaged unduly the usefulness,
the necessity, of party organization or party
spirit as a mode of the secondary machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by which the great affairs of the world are
carried on; but he was a signal example of
a man who not only could be measured by no
party standard, but who absolutely disregarded
it. He never, during the whole course
of his long life, took any active part, never, I
believe, voted in those elections which, to
most of us, are the very breath of our nostrils.
For its own sake he cherished whatever was
worth preserving; for its own sake he hailed
whatever improvement was worth effecting.
He cared not under what name or by what
man the preservation or the improvement was
achieved. This, too, is an ideal which few
can attain, which still fewer attempt; but it
is something to have had one man who was
possest by it as a vital and saving truth. And
such a man was the Prophet of Chelsea. But
there was that in him which, in spite of his
own contemptuous description of the people,
in spite of his scorn for the struggles of party,
endeared him, in no common degree, even to
those who most disagreed with him&mdash;even to
the humblest classes of our great community.
He was an eminent instance of how a man
can trample on the most cherished idols of
the market-place, if yet he shows that he has
in his heart of hearts the joys, the sorrows,
the needs of his toiling, suffering fellow
creatures. In this way they insensibly felt
drawn toward that tender, fervid nature
which was weak when they were weak, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
burned with indignation when they suffered
wrong. They felt that, if he despised them, it
was in love; if he refused to follow their bidding,
it was because he believed that their
bidding was an illusion.</p>

<p>And for that independence of party of
which I spoke, there was also the countervailing
source, that no man could for a moment dream
that it arose from indifference to his country.
He was no monk; he was no hermit dwelling
apart from the passions which sway the destinies
of a great nation. There is no man living
to whom the thrift, the industry, the valor
of his countrymen were so deeply precious.
There is no man living, to whom, had it been
possible for him to have been aroused from
the torpor of approaching death, the news
would have been more welcome that the Parliament
of England had been in the last
week saved from becoming a byword and reproach
and shame among the nations of the
earth. And all this arose out of a frame of
mind which others have shared with him, but
which, perhaps, few have been able to share
to the same extent. The earnestness, almost
the very word is his own, the earnestness, the
seriousness, with which he approached the
great problems of all human life, have made
us feel them also. The tides of fashion have
swept over the minds of many who once were
swayed by his peculiar tones; but there must
be many a young man whose first feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
generosity and public spirit were roused
within him by the cry as if from the very
depths of his heart, "Where, now, are your
Hengists and your Horsas? Where are those
leaders who should be leading their people to
useful employments, to distant countries,
where are they? Preserving their game!"
Before his withering indignation all false pretensions,
all excuses for worthless idleness and
selfish luxury, fell away. The word which he
invented to describe them has sunk, perhaps,
into cant and hollowness; but it had a truth
when first he uttered it. Those falsities were
shams, and they who practised them were
guilty of the sin which the Bible, in scathing
scorn, calls hypocrisy.</p>

<p>And whence came this earnestness? Deep
down in the bottom of his soul it springs from
his firm conviction that there was a higher,
a better world than that visible to our outward
senses. All, whether called saints, in the
middle ages, or Puritans, in the seventeenth
century, or what you like in our own day, he
revered them, with all their eccentricities, as
bright and learned examples of those who
"sacrificed their lives to their higher natures,
their worser to their better parts." In addressing
the students of Edinburgh, he bade
them remember that the deep recognition of
the eternal justice of heaven, and the unfailing
punishment of crimes against the law of
God, is at the origin and foundation of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the histories of nations. No nation which did
not contemplate this wonderful universe with
an awe-stricken and reverential belief that
there was a great unknown, omnipotent, all-wise,
and all-just Being superintending all
men and all interests in it, no nation ever
came to very much, nor did any man either,
who forgot that. If a man forgot that, he
forgot the most important part of his mission
in the world. So he spoke, and the ground
of his hope for Europe&mdash;of his hope, we may
say, against hope&mdash;was that, after all, in any
commonwealth where the Christian religion
exists, nay, in any commonwealth where it has
once existed, public or private virtue, the
basis of all good, never can become extinct;
but in every new age, and even from the deepest
decline, there is a chance, and, in the
course of ages, the certainty, of renovation.
The divine depths of sorrow, the sanctuary
of sorrow, the life and death of the divine
Man, were, to him, Christianity. We stand,
as it were, beside him whilst the grave has not
yet closed over those flashing eyes, over those
granite features, over that weird form on
which we have so often looked, whilst the silence
of death has fallen on that house which
was once so frequented and so honored. We
call up memories which occurred to ourselves.
One such, in the far past, may, perchance,
come with peculiar force to those whose work
is appointed in this place. Many years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whilst I belonged to another cathedral, I met
him in St. James' Park, and walked with him
to his own house. It was during the Crimean
war; and after hearing him denounce, with
his vigorous and, perhaps, exaggerated earnestness,
the chaos and confusion into which
our administration had fallen, and the doubt
and distrust which pervaded all classes at the
time, I ventured to ask him, "What, under
the circumstances, is your advice to a canon
of an English cathedral?" He grimly laughed
at my question. He paused for a moment and
then answered, in homely and well-known
words; but which were, as it happened, especially
fitted to situations like that in which
he was asked to give his counsel&mdash;"Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with all
thy might." That is, no doubt, the lesson
he leaves to each one of us in this place, and
also to this weary world&mdash;the world of which
he felt the weariness as age and infirmity grew
upon him&mdash;the lesson which, in his more active
days, he practised to the very letter. He
is at rest, he is at rest; delivered from that
burden of the flesh against which he chafed
and fretted: he is at rest! In his own words,
"Babylon, with its deathening inanity, rages
on to the dim innocuous and unheeded forever."
From the "silence of the eternities,"
of which he so often spoke, there still sound,
and will long sound, the tones of that marvelous
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us take one tender expression, written
three or four years ago&mdash;one plaintive yet
manful thought, which has never yet reached
the public eye: "Three nights ago, stepping
out after midnight and looking up at the stars,
which were clear and numerous, it struck me
with a strong, new kind of feeling: 'In a little
while I shall have seen you also for the last
time. God Almighty's own theater of immensity&mdash;the
infinite made palpable and visible
to me&mdash;that also will be closed&mdash;flung too
in my face&mdash;and I shall never behold death
any more.' The thought of the eternal deprivation
even of this, tho this is such a nothing
in comparison, was sad and painful to
me. And then a second feeling rose upon
me: 'What if Omnipotence that has developed
in me these appetites, these reverences, these
infinite affections, should actually have said,
Yes, poor mortal, such as you who have gone
so far, shall be permitted to go further. Hope!
despair not!' God's will, not ours, be done."</p>

<p>Yes, God's will be done for us and for him.
The Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles John Vaughan</span>, Church of
England divine and educator, was born
at Leicester in 1816, and educated at
Rugby under Dr. Arnold. He was ordained
in 1841 and in 1844 elected headmaster
of Harrow. But the post which
gave him the best opportunity as a
preacher, was that of Master of the
Temple which he occupied from 1869 to
1894. He was a leader in the Broad
Church party and his sermons are marked
by simplicity of diction, deep sincerity,
and rare spiritual insight. He died at
Llandoff, of which he had been dean since
1879, in 1897.</p>

<h2>VAUGHAN</h2>

<h3>1816-1897</h3>

<h4>GOD CALLING TO MAN</h4>

<p><em>And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto
him, Where art thou?</em>&mdash;Genesis iii., 9.</p>


<p>"I wish," said a great man of our day,
"that some one would preach under
the dome of St. Paul's, on the text,
'Where art thou, Adam?'" A noble subject,
my brethren, when we think of it! But who
is equal to the task of handling it? The work
of God is quick and powerful&mdash;may it be so
now, He Himself using it, and prospering it
in the thing whereto He sent it.</p>

<p>I shall ask you to look very closely into the
text itself. I need not tell anyone whence it
comes; from the midst of that awful story
which tells us of the first sin, and of its immediate
consequences. That same story is in
substance acted over and over again in every
marked sin that is ever done by any man: the
same mode of temptation; first inward question,
"Yea, hath God said? is this thing which
I wish to do really forbidden?" and then the
thought of the hardship; "God doth know
that this which He has forbidden is something
desirable, something delightful; it is
hard that it should be denied me;" and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the growing confidence, "I shall not surely
die for it;" and then the last review of all
the advantages, "good for food&mdash;pleasant to
the eyes&mdash;to be desired to make me wise, or
to make me happy, or to make me independent;"
and then the act itself&mdash;the taking and
eating; and then the sense of leanness entering
into the very soul. But that is not all
which sin brings after it. The next tells us
of a summons, and after the context of an
arraigning, and an examination, and at first
a self-excusing, and then of a conviction, and
a silencing, and a judgment: only one little
word of comfort, one little streak of light,
amidst all the sorrow, and all the curse, and
all the gloom.</p>

<p>But I intend to sever the text now somewhat
from its context, and to look into it,
with you, by itself alone. "The Lord God
called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
art thou?" There is the speaker&mdash;God, the
Lord God. There is the person spoken to&mdash;Adam,
the first man; Adam, from whom we
all sprang; the father, and the likeness, and
the representative of us all. There is the nature
of the address&mdash;a call, a summons, decisive,
authoritative, majestic. There are, at
last, the words uttered&mdash;few and plain, yet,
when looked into, big with meaning&mdash;"Where
art thou?" And we shall not end without
appealing to all of you, to each of you separately,
to answer that question; to answer it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
truly, as we shall all have to answer it one
day.</p>

<p>Now I shall not occupy your time, or use
many words, about the speaker. There are
those who profess to doubt the being of God;
and there are those, on the other hand, who
profess to prove it. I shall not suspect you
of the one, and I shall not endeavor to do the
other. I am quite sure that in your inmost
hearts you do not doubt His being; and I am
quite certain that, if you do, I cannot prove
it to you. The being of God is not a matter
of argument, it is a matter of instinct. The
doubt or denial of it may pass muster with
scoffing men in robust health and prosperous
circumstances; but nine out of ten of those
same men, finding themselves in sudden danger,
by land or sea, from accident or disease,
will be heard praying: they may conceal it,
they may disown it, they may be ashamed of
it afterwards&mdash;but they did it: and that
prayer was a witness, an unimpeachable witness,
that down in the depths of their heart
there was a belief in God all the time; in their
works alike and in their words they deny
Him, but in their inmost souls, like the very
spirits of evil, they believe and tremble. God,
then, speaks here. I tell you not who He is:
you know it; you know that there is such a
person, your creator, your ruler, your judge:
happy if you know also that He is the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, to whom does He here speak? I will
say two things of His call as here described:
First, that it is an individual call; and, secondly,
that it is a universal call. We try to
make God's call a vague one. It is for some
one, no doubt; but every natural man tries
to put it away from himself. In hearing a
sermon, everyone thinks how suitable this reproof
or that warning is to his neighbor; he
goes away to wish that such a person had
heard it, to hope that such a person listened
to it; but the person who thus hopes, and
probably, too, the person thus hoped about,
never thought of taking it home&mdash;never said
to himself, tho he was but too ready to
say to another, "Thou art the man." Nevertheless,
God's call is an individual one. The
only use of it is to be so. O that we could
hear it in that spirit! O that we could practise
ourselves in so hearing it! Where art
thou? not, where is he? still less, generally,
where are they? Read the Bible thus, my
brethren, as written for you, for your learning,
for your reproof, for your comfort&mdash;yours
individually and personally&mdash;and you will
never need it in vain.</p>

<p>But this individual call is also universal.
Let us not flatter ourselves that we are more
to God than others are: it is a very common,
tho a well-disguised notion. We think
that our souls are more important than any
others; and that is the least form of the error:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but we go on to think our faults are more
excusable, our sins more venial, than those of
others; we go on to think that God will
spare us when He does not spare others; we
go on to think that our virtues are greater,
our self-denials more meritorious, than those
of others; and by this time we have got farther
away from the truth and the gospel,
than the poor self-condemning sinner who
feels, and denies it not, that he is yet in the
gall of bitterness, in the very bond of iniquity.</p>

<p>The call of God, like the care of God, is
universal. It is to the race. It is to His
creatures. Hear the word&mdash;"The Lord God
called unto Adam, and said unto him." If
it had been, God called to Abraham, or to
Moses, or to David, there would have been
some particularity, perhaps some limitation,
in the summons; but none of us can say he
is not included when Adam is spoken to; he
is, indeed, the father of us all: of him we all
come. What God says to him, He certainly
says to us&mdash;to us all, as to each of us.</p>

<p>But we ask, perhaps, thirdly: How does
God call to us? I will say, in three ways.
He calls within&mdash;in conscience. Can you tell
me what that thing is in each of us which
seems at once so intimate with us, yet so independent
of us, that it knows everything we
do, or say, or even think, and yet sits in judgment
upon us for everything? Is it not a
strange thing? We should expect that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
whole man would move together; that, if we
did a thing, if we said a thing, if we thought
a thing, we should go along with it, we should
approve that thing: but is it so? No; we
carry about within us a whole machinery of
judicature; a witness, a jury, a judge, yes, an
executioner, too; and, strange to say, it is in
early life that the process is most perceptible,
just while we are most ignorant, least reflecting,
least logical in our judgments. It is the
work of many men through life to stifle the
voice within, and at last they almost succeed:
but do not tell me that you have no such voice
within&mdash;certainly you will not say that you
never had it; and I will tell you what that voice
is, or was. It was the voice of the Lord God
within, calling to Adam, and saying, "Where
art thou?"</p>

<p>He calls also without&mdash;in providence. I
really know not whether this be not the most
persuasive of all His modes of calling to us;
certainly it is the most authoritative of all.
Conscience may be stifled, but providence
grasps us very tightly&mdash;we cannot escape from
it. Tell me, who caused you to be born where
and what you were? Who settled that you
should be born in this country and not in
that? Who decided that you were to have
poor parents or rich, Christian parents or un-Christian?
Who has managed your circumstances
for you since you had a being? Who
gave you, who has continued to give you, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
vigor of mind and body, your power of enjoyment,
or your experience of kindness, or your
principles of judgment, or your instincts of
affection? Who took away from you that
friend for whom you are now mourning&mdash;that
parent, that brother, that sister, that wife,
that child? Yes, we may forget it, or we may
fret under it, but in the hands of a providence
we all are; we are utterly powerless in that
grasp: and whether we will believe it or no,
that power is a voice too&mdash;a call from God
without, even as conscience is His voice and
His call within.</p>

<p>Once more, God calls from above also&mdash;in
revelation. My friend, believest thou the
Scriptures? I know that thou believest.
Your presence here seems to say that you
do. And yet in this multitude how many
must there be who do not in their hearts
believe! Let me rather say, who do not in
their lives believe; for in your hearts I think
you do: sure I am that there are some parts
of the Bible which you cannot read and disbelieve;
of course you may leave them unread,
that is always possible&mdash;easier than to
read them&mdash;but I do not think you can read
the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, for example,
in the Old Testament, and I do not think
you can read one chapter of St. John's Gospel
in the New Testament, and shut the
book, saying, "There is nothing in it." I suspect
that is why we so often leave the Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
unread&mdash;just because we believe it; we feel,
when we do read it, that it is God's voice, and
we do not want to hear that voice. The Bible
is more its own witness than we like oftentimes
to admit.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who that has felt its glance of dread<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thrill through his heart's remotest cells,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>God speaks; and speaks to us&mdash;to each of
us and to all of us; and speaks, chiefly in three
ways&mdash;in conscience, in providence, in revelation:
and now, fourthly, what is His call?
How is it here briefly exprest? It might have
been put, it is put in the Bible, in different
forms&mdash;but how is it here exprest? "The
Lord called unto Adam, and said unto him,
Where art thou?" This is a call, first, to
attention. As tho God had said, Listen to Me.
That is the first step in all religion. What we
want first is a spirit of attention. It is the
great art of our enemy to keep our thoughts
off religion. That is the meaning of the overwhelming
cares of life. The devil would occupy
our whole time and thoughts with something
which is not, and has nothing (as he
persuades us) to do with God. That is the
meaning of the excessive amusements of life.
The cares of life are not enough to engross
the attention of all men always; and therefore
the enemy provides something which shall alternate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with them for some men, and take
the place of them for others. It is this art
which God, in His mercy, in His long-suffering,
in His desire that we should not perish,
has to counteract by His divine skill. He
takes a man aside now and then, from time to
time&mdash;blest be His name for it!&mdash;and makes
him listen. He interposes by some chastisement,
some sickness, some bereavement, and
constrains him to hearken to what He, the
Lord God, has to say concerning him and to
him. This is the first point gained. Behold, he
listens! better still, Behold, he prayeth! It
is a call, next, to the recognition of God's
being, and of our responsibility to Him.
"Where art thou?" It is as if He had said,
I am, and thou art Mine. As if He has said,
I have a right to know about thee, and thou
canst not evade Me. As if He had said, I am
about, now, to enter into judgment with thee:
give an account of thy stewardship. Yes, my
brethren, it is an awful moment, when a man
first becomes distinctly conscious that God is,
and is something to him. He may have talked
of God before: he may have fancied that he
knew all about Him: he may even have prayed
before, and confest himself before, and asked
grace and help before: but now, for the first
time, he sees how much more there is in all
this than he has yet dreamed of; and the only
words which he can find at all to express his
new feeling, are those of the patriarch of old&mdash;"I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have heard of thee by the hearing of the
ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore
I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
ashes."</p>

<p>It is a call, once more, and yet more particularly,
to reflect upon our place or our position.
I know not how else to express the force
of the inquiry, "Where art thou?" It may
be read literally&mdash;of place. May not some one
of those here assembled have been, ere now,
perhaps often, perhaps quite recently, in some
place in which the question, "Where art
thou?" would have had a startling and condemning
sound?&mdash;some place where he was
sinning? some place where he had gone to
sin? some place where he would not for the
world have been seen by any human eye, and
where he gladly forgot that there was yet one
eye which did see him? Oh, if God stood
this night upon earth, and called aloud to the
"Adam" of this generation&mdash;to the men and
women who form now the sum of the living
human creation; if He should call them suddenly
from the east and from the west to
avow exactly where they were, and to come
forth from that place as they were, without
an instant allowed them to cover up and disguise
themselves; oh, what a revelation would
it be of action and of character! Oh, who
might abide the scrutiny of that question?
Oh, who could stand when that inquirer appeared?
But, even if the literal local question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
could be well answered, there would remain
yet another behind applicable to all men.
"Where art thou?" is an inquiry as to position
no less than place. It says, "What is
thy present place as a man with a soul, as an
immortal being? What is thy present standing,
thy present state? Art thou safe? Art
thou happy? Art thou useful? Art thou
doing the work I gave thee to do? Is it well
with thee in the present? Is it well with thee
in the future? Say not, I can not answer, I
know not. I have taught thee how to judge
of thyself; now therefore advise, and see what
answer thou wilt return to Him that made
thee."</p>

<p>My brethren, I propose, in the last place,
that we all answer this question. It is a very
serious thing to do; and it is what no man
can do for his brother. Each one of us has
one secret place, one sanctuary within the veil,
into which, not even once a year, not even in
the character of a high priest, can earthly foot
ever enter. Yet in that secret place shines
forth the light of God's presence; a light
never put out altogether in any man, so far
at least as its disclosing and revealing character
is concerned, until sin and perverseness
have done their perfect work, and the awful
words are at length fulfilled, "If the light
that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness!" At present, we will humbly hope,
that this last ruin has not been wrought in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
one who hears me. And if not, I repeat it, we
can all, if we will, answer God's question,
when He calls to each of us, as He does this
night, and says, "Where art thou?"</p>

<p>One of us, perhaps, answers, if he speaks
truly, I am wandering. I have left my
Father's home; I took my portion of His goods,
and carried them away into a far country.
Yes, He was very generous to me; He grudged
me nothing; life and health, food and clothing,
even success in the world, even human
friendship and human love, He gave me all
these, and upbraided not: He warned me that
I should be sorry one day if I left Him; He
cautioned me against the perils of my way;
He told me that I should not find happiness;
He bade me, if I wished for that, to stay; He
bade me, if I should ever be sorry that I had
gone, to arise instantly and return. My heart
was young then, and I thought I knew best; I
left Him, with little feeling, with much expectation;
His last look was one of regretful
love that I left Him and I am a wanderer
still. Sometimes I have arisen to go to my
Father, but I went not: I was ashamed, I was
afraid, I thought I was too sinful, I felt myself
unstable, I feared that I might relapse,
I dreaded reproach, I dreaded ridicule, I
dreaded, above all, the sight of that face:&mdash;and
thus stayed where I was, in the far country&mdash;I
am a wanderer, an outcast still. And another
answers, like him to whom the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the text was first put, I am hiding. I have
sinned and I have not repented. I have eaten
of the tree of which God said to me, "Thou
shalt not eat of it, neither shalt thou touch
it, lest thou die." I believed the creature more
than the Creator&mdash;the tempter more than the
Savior. I went to the edge of temptation; I
desired forbidden knowledge first, and then
I could not rest until I knew by experience
also; and now my heart is defiled, my conscience
is defiled, my life is defiled; I have
lost all right to the beatific vision, for I am
no longer pure in heart; now, when I hear
the voice of the Lord God, I hide myself, because
I know myself sinful, and because I
know that He is of purer eyes than to look
upon or tolerate iniquity. And another answers,
I am resting. Earth is very pleasant
to me; I have toiled and I have reaped; I have
gathered myself a competence; I have found
the happiness of lawful love; I have built myself
a nest here, I have fenced it against the
blasts of fortune, I am warm and tranquil
within: let me alone a little while; it is not
long that I can enjoy it; soon calamity may
come, loss, sickness, death, into my peaceful
home; then I will turn and seek Thee&mdash;not
yet, O not just yet! And another says, I am
working. Am I not doing Thy work? Am I
not discharging the duties of my station? Am
I not setting an example of diligence and
sobriety? Am I not availing myself of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
faculties which Thou has given to make myself
respectable, and useful, and exemplary in my
generation? How can I do all this, and yet
be religious? How can I find time for both
worlds at once? But yet, indeed, am I not
providing for that other world in making a
proper use of this? Let me alone a little
while; when I have a convenient season, I will
call for Thee. And another says, honestly, I
am trifling. The world is so gay, so amusing,
so exciting: hast Thou not made it so for our
enjoyment? Oh, grudge me not my brief time
of mirth and forgetfulness; I shall be serious
enough one day. And another says, I am
coming. Yes, I am on my way. This is no
world, I see it, of rest for me. There is no
peace but in God: I sought it once elsewhere,
and found it not: now I know my error; yes,
I am coming, I am coming, I am on my way:
but give me time: so great a change cannot be
wrought all at once: heaven cannot be won
in a day: give me time, and I will reach
Thee. I am now using the means: I pray, I
read the Bible, I go to Thy House, I partake
in Christ's supper: surely this is the way to
Thee!</p>

<p>Yes, my brother, but why this delay? Why
this postponement of the desired result? Wilt
thou be any fitter to-morrow than to-day for
that step across the barrier which now seems
so premature, so presumptuous? The word is
very nigh thee: it is in thy mouth, it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thy heart&mdash;thou knowest it well, even the word
of faith&mdash;"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,"
at once, "and thou shalt be saved. Come unto
me"&mdash;not to-morrow, but to-day&mdash;"all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest." Are there any here present&mdash;God
grant that they be many!&mdash;who have yet one
other answer to return to the question on
which we have dwelt? Thou sayest to me, O
Lord, "Where art thou?" Lord, I am a
sinner in a world of danger; and I have
learned that danger in myself; for I have
fallen, and I have sinned against Thee, times
without number; yet by Thy grace I have
risen, and I have returned to Thee, and Thou
hast accepted me in Thy Son, and hast endued
me, according to my need, with Thy Holy
Spirit. And now, Lord, my life is hid with
Christ in Thee: He is my trust, He is my life,
He is my hope, and the life that I now live
upon earth, I live by faith in Him. Under
Thy care, doing Thy work, thankful for Thy
mercies, trusting in Thy strength, even now
I am Thine, and hereafter I shall see Thee.
Guide Thou my steps, make Thy way plain
before me, in the days that remain to me,
and at last receive me to Thyself, disciplined,
humbled, sanctified, that I may rest in Thee
forever, and forever see Thy glory!</p>

<p>My brethren, the work of God in each of us
would be almost accomplished if this one call
were heard within. Once let us know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
God is speaking to us, and that He waits an
answer; once let us feel that He is, and that
He will have us to be saved, and all the rest
will follow. May it be so now! May some
wanderer this night return to his Father;
some hiding soul this night come forth from
its lurking place; some builder upon the sand
lay this night his foundations upon the rock;
some trifler be made serious; some worldly
man turned heavenward&mdash;so that all may have
cause to bless God for His word here spoken,
and ascribe to Him, through eternal ages,
thanksgiving, and blessing, and praise!</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Christopher Newman Hall</span>, Congregational
divine, was born at Maidstone,
Kent, in 1816. He was widely known as
a writer, lecturer, and preacher of great
eloquence. During the Civil War he was
enthusiastic in advocating the cause of the
North, and subsequently two extended
tours in the United States brought him
international fame. His tract, "Come to
Jesus," published in 1846, has been translated
into over twenty languages. He
died in 1902.</p>

<h2>NEWMAN HALL</h2>

<h3>1816-1902</h3>

<h4>CHRISTIAN VICTORY</h4>

<p><em>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in
the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth
saving he that receiveth it.</em>&mdash;Rev. ii., 17.</p>


<p>The Christian life is often compared in
Scripture to a warfare. Followers of
Jesus are "soldiers." They are exhorted
to put on "the whole armor of God."
They "fight the good fight of faith." Some of
you have been engaged in the conflict: others
have more recently entered upon it. But,
whether young or old in the Christian career,
all find it necessary to be constantly stirred
up to watchfulness against the never-ceasing
assaults of the foe. It is not enough to put
on the armor and to commence the battle. He
that overcometh, and he alone, will receive the
salutation, "Well done, good and faithful
servant,"&mdash;he alone shall "lay hold upon
eternal life."</p>

<p>But we are not left to fight without encouragement.
As generals before a battle go in
front of their troops to stimulate them to
valor, so Christ, the Captain of our Salvation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
leads on the consecrated hosts of His elect;
and having himself set us a glorious example
of valor and victory, animates us to follow in
His footsteps by the "exceeding great and
precious promises" of His word. Christian
warrior! let your eye be lifted up to Him.
Behold Him beckoning you onward. Listen to
Him, as from His throne of glory He exhorts
you to persevering valor against the foe; and
pray earnestly that His promise may be fulfilled
in your case: "To him that overcometh
will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and
will give him a white stone, and in the stone
a new name written, which no man knoweth
saving he that receiveth it."</p>

<p>Let us consider first, the promise; then, the
condition attached to it.</p>

<p>I. The promise. This is twofold,&mdash;the hidden
manna and the white stone.</p>

<p>1. The hidden manna.&mdash;God fed the Israelites
in the wilderness with manna. A portion
of this was laid by in the ark, and thus was
hidden from public view. It is here referred
to as a figurative representation of the spiritual
blessings bestowed upon the victor in the
heavenly fight. Christ, speaking of the manna
as a type of Himself, said, "I am the bread
which came down from heaven." The manna
in the wilderness sustained the life of the
Israelites.</p>

<p>But there is another life more important
than that of the body. By sin the soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dead, dead toward God. By the Holy Spirit,
the "dead in trespasses and sins" are "quickened,"
or made alive. As the life of the
new-born infant cannot be preserved without
food, so the new spiritual life which God
imparts needs continual support. Both the
life, and the nourishing of it, come from
Christ, and Christ alone. By His sacrifice
that life becomes possible; and by His spirit
working within our hearts that life becomes
actual. He sustains as well as imparts spiritual
vitality. He is the food of our faith:
"believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved." He is the food of our love:
"we love him because he first loved us." He
is the food of our obedience: "the love of
Christ constraineth us." He is the food of
our peace: for when "justified by faith, we
have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
Lord." He is the food of our joy: for if "we
joy in God" it is "through Jesus Christ our
Lord."</p>

<p>The manna which sustained the Israelites
was evidently the gift of God. And so this
"hidden manna" is from heaven. It is no
contrivance of man&mdash;no philosophy of human
invention. It is a divine plan for the salvation
of our ruined race. "God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish but should have everlasting life."
That manna in the wilderness was sweet to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
taste; yet they who fed on it grew weary of it.
But the more we eat of the bread of life, the
more we relish it&mdash;the greater is our appetite
for it. That manna in the wilderness was
needed daily. And so with this heavenly
bread. Yesterday's supply will not suffice
for to-day. The prayer is as needful for the
soul as for the body: "Give us this day our
daily bread." But if that manna was needed
daily, so it was supplied; none went in vain
at the appointed season&mdash;and no soul that
"hungers and thirsts after righteousness" is
sent empty away. The manna was supplied
to the Israelites till they came to the promised
land&mdash;so God has promised that His grace
shall not fail His people through their
wanderings.</p>

<p>It is spoken of as the "hidden manna."
Such is the Christian's life. "Our life is hid
with Christ in God." The outward effects of
it may be seen, but the inner life is invisible.
So is the nourishing of the life. You may see
the Christian on his knees, you may hear the
words which he utters, but you cannot see the
streams of divine influence which are poured
into his spirit; nor hear the sweet whispers of
divine love which fill him with joy; nor comprehend
the peace passing all understanding
which he is permitted to experience. Unbelievers
are often amazed at what they see in
the Christian. He is troubled on every side,
yet not in despair. Waves of sorrow beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
upon his frail vessel, yet it does not sink. Men
now threaten, now allure, but he holds on his
way. What to others is an irresistible charm,
is no attraction to him. What is a terror to
others, deters not him. Why does he not faint
beneath the burden? why does he not sink in
the storm? Because he eats of the "hidden
manna." "The secret of the Lord is with
them that fear him." "He hath taken him
into his banqueting-room, and the banner over
him is love."</p>

<p>Were this promise merely the reward of
final victory, that victory itself would never
be gained. We need to eat this manna during
our pilgrimage. We cannot live without it.
Every act of overcoming will be followed by a
verification of the promise, "I will give him
to eat of the hidden manna." Yet we must
look beyond the present life for its full
accomplishment. "To him that overcometh"
at the last "shall be given the hidden
manna," in a sense of which at present we
have but a very faint conception.</p>

<p>As the manna was hidden in the ark, and
that ark was hidden behind the curtain of the
Holy of Holies, so the Christian's hope, "as
an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast,
enters into that which is within the veil."
Those joys we cannot yet conjecture; their
splendor is too intense; we should be blinded
by excessive light; we should be overpowered
by the excellent glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>One look of heaven would unfit us for
earth. It is wisely appointed that at present
this manna should in one sense be hidden,
even from ourselves. We are as yet but
babes&mdash;such strong meat would not suit us
now; we must be content with simpler fare.
But oh! if the manna, tho at present so
partially and imperfectly appreciated, can
produce such peace and joy, what must be
the bliss of entering into the holiest of all,
and there, in the presence of God Himself,
feasting on it eternally! Unceasing, unlimited
reception of divine influences into the
soul!</p>

<p>Uninterrupted fellowship with Him who is
the only fountain of life, and purity, and
happiness! Perfect love! But at present such
full fruition is "hidden." "Now we see
through a glass darkly"; "now we know but
in part"; "it doth not yet appear what we
shall be." But how unspeakably blest are
they to whom, partially in this world and perfectly
in the next, the promise shall be verified:
"To him that overcometh will I give to
eat of the hidden manna"!</p>

<p>2. The white stone.&mdash;Reference is made to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera hospitalis</i>, the tally or token of
hospitality employed by the ancients. At a
time when houses of public entertainment
were less common, private hospitality was the
more necessary. When one person was received
kindly by another, or a contract of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
friendship was entered into, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i> was
given. It was so named from its shape, being
four-sided; it was sometimes of wood; sometimes
of stone; it was divided into two by the
contracting parties; each wrote his own name
on half of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>; then they exchanged
pieces, and therefore the name or device on the
piece of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i> which each received, was the
name the other person had written upon it,
and which no one else knew but him who
received it. It was carefully prized, and
entitled the bearer to protection and hospitality.</p>

<p>Plautus, in one of his playes, refers to this
custom. Hanno inquires of a stranger where
he may find Agorastocles, and discovers to his
surprize that he is addressing the object of his
search.</p>

<p>"If so," he says, "compare, if you please,
this hospitable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>; here it is; I have it
with me."</p>

<p>Agorastocles replies, "It is the exact
counterpart; I have the other part at home."</p>

<p>Hanno responds, "O my friend! I rejoice
to meet thee; thy father was my friend, my
guest; I divided with him this hospitable
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>." "Therefore," said Agorastocles,
"thou shalt have a home with me, for I reverence
hospitality."</p>

<p>Beautiful illustration of gospel truth! The
Savior visits the sinner's heart, and being received
as a guest, bestows the white stone, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
token of His unchanging love. It is not we
who in the first instance desire this compact.
Far from it.</p>

<p>But Jesus, anxious to bless us, kindly forces
Himself on our regard. By His spirit, he
persuades us to give Him admission to our
hearts. "Behold, I stand at the door and
knock; if any man hear my voice and open
the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
with him, and he with me." We often disregarded
His appeal. Yet, with what condescending
kindness did he persevere! And
when at length we opened the door, we saw
Him laden with blessings which He had been
long waiting to bestow. The feast which was
then spread was all of His providing. He
who went to be "the guest of one that was a
sinner," inverts the usual course. He invites
Himself and brings the feast. What have we
fit to set before so august and holy a visitant?
But He who chooses the sinner's heart as His
banqueting-chamber, spreads there His choicest
gifts, His exceeding great and precious
promises, His finished sacrifice, His human
sympathy, His perfect example, His pure precepts,
His all-prevailing intercession, the various
developments of His infinite love.</p>

<p>He "sups with us," and makes us "sup
with Him." He enrolls our name among His
friends. "He makes an everlasting covenant
with us, ordered in all things and sure." He
promises never to leave nor forsake us. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
tells us we "shall never perish." He gives
us the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>, the white stone!</p>

<p>Is not this "the witness of the Spirit,"
the "earnest of the promised possession"?
Does not "the Spirit witness with our spirit
that we are born of God"? Does not our
experience of the friendship of Jesus correspond
with what we are taught of it in the
Scriptures? "I know in whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able to
keep that which I have committed unto him,
against that day." The "love of God is shed
abroad" in the heart of the believer. He says,
with humble confidence, "My Lord, and my
God!"</p>

<p>On this white stone is inscribed a "new
name." The part of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i> which each
of the contracting parties received contained
the name of the other. And, therefore, "the
new name" on the "white stone," which he
that overcometh receives, is that of Him who
gives. By the unbeliever, God is known as
Power, as Majesty, as Justice. He is dreaded.
"The carnal mind is enmity against God."
The Christian alone knows Him as "Love!"
Jehovah has now "a new name." He was
once a ruler&mdash;now He is Friend; He was
once judge&mdash;now He is Father.</p>

<p>Do you know God by His "new name"?
Do you so know Him as to wish no longer
to hide from Him, but to hide in Him, as the
only home the universe can furnish in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you can be safe and happy? Have you learned
to say, "Our Father which art in heaven"?
If we have, indeed, received this "white
stone," let us continually be reading the "new
name" engraven on it. Here I am assured
that the Holy Ghost is my teacher, my guide,
my comforter; that the eternal Word, the
only begotten Son, is my Savior, my Friend,
my Brother; that the infinite Jehovah is my
Father, and that "like as a father pitieth his
children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear
him."</p>

<p>We are told that no man knoweth this new
name, "saving he that receiveth it." He
knows it for himself, but no one else can
read it for him. Thus it resembles the "hidden
manna." The frivolous may deride, fools
may mock, the unbeliever may deny, the
sceptic may bring forth his objections in all
the pride of a false philosophy, but the
Christian, even if unable to reply to the
caviller, or to make intelligible to any other
mind his own strong assurance, has an evidence
within him which nothing can shake,
for God has written on his heart "His new
best name of Love."</p>

<p>Fellow pilgrims to the heavenly Canaan,
how precious is this token! We are travelers
through the desert; for tho the enjoyments
of earth are many, yet this life, compared with
what is to come, is a wilderness. We are
away from home; we are exposed to privations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
tempests, foes; we constantly need a
refuge. But we are never far from the house
of a friend. Everywhere, in every city and in
every village, on the desert and on the ocean,
in the solitude of secrecy, and in the solitude
of a crowd, in the bustle of business, and in the
sick chamber, a Friend is at hand, who will
always recognize the white stone He gave us,
a token of His love. We have only to present
it to claim the fulfilment of His promise.</p>

<p>How wide will the door be thrown open for
our reception! What divine entertainment we
shall receive! what safety from peril! what
succor in difficulty! what comfort in trouble!
what white raiment! what heavenly food! O
that we valued the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i> more, that we
sought more frequent interviews with our
heavenly Friend, that we more habitually resorted
as invited guests to Jesus, and dwelt
in Him as the home of our souls! We shall
never find the door closed against us; we shall
never be received reluctantly; He will never
allow us to think that we are intruders. Jesus
is never ashamed of His poor relations, nor
treats them coldly because they need His help.
The greater our distress, the more shall we
prove His liberality and tender sympathy.</p>

<p>And as regards this stone, as well as the
hidden manna, we can look beyond the present
life. A day is coming when we shall be compelled
to leave the homes of earth, however
endeared. We must embrace for the last time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the friends united to us as our own souls.
Tho we have traveled along the road many
a year together, we must now separate, and
go alone. They may accompany us to the
river side, but we must cross it by ourselves.
What cheering voice will greet us then? What
kind roof will receive us then? What loving
friend will welcome us then?</p>

<p>But we shall not have left our best treasure
behind us! No! we shall carry the white stone
with us; and with this we shall look for no
inferior abode, but with unhesitating step shall
advance at once right up to the palace of the
Great King. We present the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>; the
"new name" is legible upon it; the angelic
guards recognize the symbol; the everlasting
gates lift up their heads; and the voice of
Jesus Himself invites us to enter, saying,
"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom!"</p>

<p>Such is the welcome that every soul shall
experience to whom the promise is fulfilled:
"I will give him a white stone, and in the
stone a new name written, which no man
knoweth, saving he that receiveth it."</p>

<p>II. The condition annexed to the promise,
"To him that overcometh!"</p>

<p>A great war is going on between the Church
and the powers of darkness. It is not an
affair of strategy between two vast armies,
wherein skilful maneuvers determine the issue,
many on either side never coming into actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
combat; but every Christian has to fight hand
to hand with the enemy. We cannot be lost
in the crowd. We may not stand in the
middle of the hollow square, without sharing
the perils of the outer rank. Every Christian
must not only occupy his post in the grand
army, but must personally grapple with the
foe.</p>

<p>Before conversion there was no fighting.
The devil's suggestions and the heart's inclination
were allied. Then we did the enemy's
bidding, or were lulled to sleep by his intoxicating
cup. But when light shone into the
soul, and we strove to escape, the struggle
began. God, as our Creator and Redeemer,
justly demands our obedience and love. Whatever
interferes with these claims, is an enemy
summoning us to battle. The world of
frivolity is our foe. How numerous and insinuating
are its temptations&mdash;the more perilous
because of the difficulty of defining them!</p>

<p>Moreover, lawful pleasures and necessary
cares become dangerous when they cease to be
subordinate to the love of God. The enjoyments
He bestows and the labors He appoints
are calculated to minister to godliness,&mdash;and
yet they may be perverted to idolatry by our
forgetting Him on whom our highest thoughts
should be fixt. What danger is there that
things in themselves holy and beautiful may
thus become pernicious and destructive!</p>

<p>The flesh, too, furnished its contingent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the army of our foes. Not that any of our
natural appetites, being divinely bestowed,
can have in them the nature of sin. No! the
flesh, as God made it, is pure and holy. But
those instincts, which, regulated by the revealed
will of their Author, are "holiness to
the Lord," may, by unhallowed gratification,
become those "fleshly lusts which war against
the soul." As we carry about with us these
animal propensities, there is necessity for
constant vigilence lest our own nature, being
abused, should become our destroyer.</p>

<p>Inbred depravity lurks in the heart of even
the true believer. Tho dethroned, it is not
completely expelled. With what selfishness,
covetousness, vanity, hastiness of temper, uncharitableness,
have we not to contend! Who
has not some sin which most easily besets him?
How varied are the forms of unbelief! Spiritual
pride, too, corrupts our very graces, piety
itself furnishing an occasion of evil, so that
when we have conquered some temptation or
performed some duty, our victory is often
tarnished, our holy things corrupted, by our
falling into the snare of self-complacency.</p>

<p>Above all, there is that great adversary who
"goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom
he may devour." He avails himself of the
world, and the flesh, and the infirmities of the
spirit, to tempt the soul of sin. This is no
fable, altho one of Satan's most skilful stratagems
is to make men disbelieve in his existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Overlooked or despised, a foe is
already half victorious. But the Captain of
our Salvation, in His word, often warns us
both of the craft and of the violence of our
adversary. We sometimes read of "the wiles
of the devil"; and sometimes of "the fiery
darts of the wicked one." They who fail to
watch and pray, are sure to be vanquished by
such a foe.</p>

<p>These are our enemies! And if we would
possess the promise we must "overcome." A
mere profession of religion is of no avail. It
is not enough for our name to appear on the
muster-roll of the camp. Many wear the
soldier's dress who know nothing of the
soldier's heart. Many are glad to glitter on
the grand parade who fall off from the hard-fought,
blood-stained battle-field. It is not
enough to buckle on our armor; many do this,
and lay it aside again. We must devote ourselves
to this great daily battle of life.</p>

<p>There is no exemption of persons. Women
must fight, as well as men; the tender and
timid must be as Amazons in the conflict.
Children must carry the shield, and wield the
sword. The aged and infirm must keep the
ranks. The sick and wounded must not be
carried to the rear. No substitute can be
provided, and there is no discharge in this
war.</p>

<p>There is no exemption on account of circumstances.
The rich and poor, the learned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the unlearned, the cheerful and the sad, all
must fight. No accumulation of trouble, no
unexpected death of friends, can be an excuse
for laying down our arms. We must go to the
marriage feast, and we must attend the
funeral procession, as warriors, wearing our
armor and grasping our weapons. We must
be like those spoken of by Nehemiah, "every
man with one hand wrought in the work, and
with the other hand held a weapon."</p>

<p>There is no exemption of place. Foes lie in
wait for the Christian wherever he goes&mdash;in
the mart of commerce, in the busy workshop,
when he returns to his home, when he rests on
his bed, in the bustle of the day, in the silence
of the night, in the circle of his friends, in the
bosom of his family, in society, alone, in the
city, in the fields, in his walks of benevolence,
in his private meditations, in the church, in
his secret retirement, when he worships with
the great congregation, and when he enters his
closet and shuts the door. He can never elude
the enemy; he carries the foe in his own
breast; the conflict ceases not!</p>

<p>There is no exemption of time, no season of
rest. No truce is sounded. Satan never beats
a retreat, except to lead us into an ambuscade.
No white flag comes out that can be trusted.
If we parley it is at our peril; if we pause, we
are wounded or taken captive. Wars on earth
may often terminate by mutual agreement.
It is a war of extermination; no quarter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
given; either we must trample Satan under
foot, or Satan will drag us down to hell!</p>

<p>It is a warfare until death. While we are
in the body it will be always true&mdash;"We
wrestle." The oldest Christian cannot lay
aside his weapons. "Having done all, stand."
A great word that! "Having done all!"
"What!" you may say, "after a long life
of conflict, surely I may put aside my armor,
and sheathe my sword, and recline on some
sunny bank, and enjoy myself after my victory!"</p>

<p>No; you must not expect it; "having done
all" it is enough if you stand at bay on the
battle-ground; all you can hope for in this
world is to maintain your post, still defying
the foe, who will be still meditating fresh
attacks. You will never be able to say with
St. Paul, "I have finished my course."</p>

<p>It is not the appearance of fighting. It is
not a few faint, irresolute strokes. "So fight
I," said the Apostle, "not as one that beateth
the air." We must be resolute, determined,
in earnest, giving our enemy no advantage.
We must "not give place to the devil." We
must watch against the smallest beginnings of
sin. By "keeping the heart with all diligence,"
by putting on "the whole armor of
God," by having faith as our shield, righteousness
as our breastplate, the hope of salvation
as our helmet, by keeping "the sword of
the Spirit" bright with exercise, "praying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with all prayer," standing near our Captain,
looking to Him, relying upon Him, knowing
that "without Him we can do nothing,"&mdash;so
must we fight! All this is necessary, if we
would overcome.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to fight this fight as some
suppose. It is not a true faith merely, an
evangelical creed, a scriptural church, a comfortable
sermon once or twice a week, a little
Sabbath-keeping, an agreeable pause in your
pleasures, giving to them a new relish&mdash;it is
not this which constitutes Christianity. You
that think religion so very easy a thing,
have a care at least, lest when too late, you
find that you know not what true religion
meant.</p>

<p>Easy? A depraved being to trample upon
his lusts&mdash;a proud being to lie prostrate with
humility and self-reproach&mdash;they that are
"slow of heart to believe," to receive the
gospel as little children?</p>

<p>Easy? To "crucify the flesh," "to deny
ungodliness," "to cut off a right hand, and
to pluck out a right eye"?</p>

<p>Easy? To be in the world, and yet not of
the world&mdash;to come out from it, not by the
seclusion of the cloister, but by holiness of
life&mdash;to be diligent in its duties, yet not
absorbed by them; appreciating its innocent
delights, and yet not ensnared by them; beholding
its attractions and yet rising superior
to them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Easy? To live surrounded by objects which
appeal to the sight, and yet to endure as seeing
what is invisible?</p>

<p>Easy? To pray and see no answer to prayer,
and still pray on&mdash;to fight this battle, and find
fresh foes ever rising up, yet still to fight
on&mdash;to be harassed with doubts and fears,
and yet walk on in darkness, tho we see no
light, staying ourselves upon God?</p>

<p>Easy? To be preparing for a world we have
never visited, in opposition to so much that is
captivating in a world where we have always
dwelt, whose beauties we have seen, whose
music we have heard, whose pleasures we have
experienced?</p>

<p>Easy? To resist that subtle foe who has cast
down so many of the wise and the mighty?</p>

<p>Easy? When Jesus says it is a "strait
gate," and that if we would enter we must
"strive," bidding us "take up our cross
daily, deny ourselves and follow him"? Ah!
it is no soft flowery meadow, along which
we may languidly stroll, but a rough, craggy
cliff that we must climb. "To him that overcometh!"
It is no smooth, placid stream, along
which we may dreamily float, but a tempestuous
ocean we must stem. "To him that
overcometh!" It is no easy lolling in a
cushioned chariot, that bears us on without
fatigue and peril. The trumpet has sounded
to arms; it is not peace, but war, war for
liberty, war for life, on the issue of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
our everlasting destiny depends! If we are to
be saved, we must "overcome."</p>

<p>But tho the conflict is arduous, the encouragements
are great. We have armor of proof.
We have a mighty Champion. Victory is
ensured to the brave. Others who stood on
the same battle-field and fought with the
same enemies, are now enjoying an eternal
triumph. Not one faithful warrior ever
perished. Their foes were not fewer than
ours, their strength was not greater. They
overcame by the same "blood of the Lamb"
on which we rely.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Once they were mourning here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And wet their couch with tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They wrestled hard, as we do now,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With sins, and doubts, and fears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">But they are wearing their crowns, they are
enjoying their rest; and the feeblest and most
unworthy of our own day, trusting in the
same Savior, shall inherit the same promise.
Then let us overcome. Sheathe not the sword,
and it shall never be wrested from you; lay
not down the shield, and no fiery dart shall
ever penetrate it; face the foe, and he shall
never trample you down, never drive you
back.</p>

<p>Listen to your Captain; how He animates
you onward! Look to the crown he is ready
to bestow upon you; eat of the hidden manna
which He gives; read the name in the "white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
stone,"&mdash;the name of God,&mdash;His name of love,
recorded for your encouragement; and thus
be animated to walk worthy of this holy
alliance, and not to allow the foe to wrench
from you such an assurance of divine favor,
such a passport to heavenly bliss.</p>

<p>A little more conflict, and that "white
stone" shall introduce you to the inheritance
above, where, in the everlasting repose of the
inner sanctuary, you shall without intermission
eat of the hidden manna.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then let my soul march boldly on,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Press forward to the heavenly gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There peace and joy eternal reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And glittering robes for conquerors wait."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of you may consider this subject
visionary and unreal. You say, "I know
nothing of this warfare. I know what the
conflict of business is, the race of fashion, the
bustle of toil or pleasure; but to anxiety about
spiritual things I am a stranger."</p>

<p>You are enjoying peace&mdash;but&mdash;what peace?
There is a captive in a dungeon&mdash;his limbs
are fast chained to the walls&mdash;yet he is singing
songs. How is it? Satan has given him to
drink of his drugged cup, and he does not
know where he is. Look at that other. He
says, "it is peace." There is truly no fighting,
but he is groveling in the dust, and the
heel of his foe is upon his neck. Such is the
peace of every one going on in his wickedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
unpardoned and unsaved. "Taken captive by
the devil at his will."</p>

<p>Chained in Satan's boat, you are swiftly
gliding down the stream to ruin, and because
it is smooth, you dream that it is safe! What
is the difference between the saint and the
sinner? Not that in the saint there is no sin.
Not that in the sinner there is never a thought
about God. The difference is this&mdash;that the
saint is overcoming his sin; but the sin is
overcoming the sinner. Oh, what a terrible
thing if sin have the upper hand! No "hidden
manna" is yours. The symbols of religion
you may look at, but real religion must be a
stranger to you. You know not its enjoyment.
You do not taste it. It is a hidden thing.
Heaven too will be hidden. You hear of its
gates of pearl&mdash;but they will never open to
you. You may catch the distant accents of its
songs&mdash;but in those songs you will never join.
And that "white stone" cannot be yours.
You have no joyful anticipation of heaven&mdash;but
a fearful looking-for of fiery indignation&mdash;or
else the insensate resolve not to think at
all. And the "new name"&mdash;no! you cannot
read it! You know God by no such name as
makes you seek His company. The thought
of Him renders you unhappy, and therefore
you banish it from your mind. You are not
now alarmed, but soon the spell may be
broken, and you may find the chains riveted
upon your soul forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>I fancy I hear you say, "I wish that before
it is too late, I could escape! But mine is a
hopeless case. My heart is hardened against
the gospel, and evil habit has so got the
mastery over me, that I have no power to
begin this conflict!"</p>

<p>No, you have no power; but One has visited
this world, and taken our nature, who can
help you. The mighty Son of God became
the suffering Son of Man that He might be the
liberator of our enslaved race. He burst open
the prison doors, that captive souls might
escape. He stands near you, ready to break
off your fetters and strengthen you to fight
the enemy who has so long opprest you.
Tell Him your simple but sad tale; how helpless,
how miserable, how ruined you are! Tell
Him you want to be saved, but know not how
to begin the work, and ask Him both to begin
and complete it for you! Let your prayer be
this: "Be merciful to me, a sinner"; and He
who "came to destroy the works of the devil,"
He "whose nature and property is ever to
have mercy and to forgive," will receive your
"humble petitions; and tho you be tied and
bound with the chain of your sins, He, in the
pitifulness of His great mercy, will loose
you."</p>

<p>He will pardon your past shameful concessions
to the foe, and, arraying you in "the
whole armor of God," and animating you with
His Holy Spirit, He will enable you so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fight against the world, the flesh, and the
devil, that you also shall share in the prize
of them that overcome; you also shall eat of
the "hidden manna," and receive the "white
stone."</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Frederick William Robertson</span>, was
born in London in 1816, educated at
Edinburgh University and took his degree
at Oxford in 1841. From a law office he
passed into the ministry, where his career,
tho brief, was exceptionally brilliant.
His English style commends itself to the
preacher's study for its naturalness,
poetic beauty, lucidity, and strength. It
is the style of a man of unique genius.
In Aug., 1847, he began his remarkable
ministry at Trinity Chapel, Brighton.
He died of consumption at Brighton in
1853, little more than thirty-six years of
age.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature in
the career of Robertson was the influence
he exercised over the workingmen. This
class had in his day become estranged
from the Church of England, few of
whose clergy had any power to attract
their attention and adherence. He was
denounced as a socialist because of his
foundation of a workingmen's institute,
and the opposition and vilification which
he thus met with no doubt helped to
shorten his life.</p>

<h2>ROBERTSON</h2>

<h3>1816-1853</h3>

<h4>THE LONELINESS OF CHRIST</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? Behold, the
hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered
every man to his own, and shall leave me alone;
and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</em>&mdash;John
xvi., 31, 32.</p></blockquote>


<p>There are two kinds of solitude: the first,
consisting of isolation in space; the
other, of isolation of the spirit. The
first is simply separation by distance. When
we are seen, touched, heard by none, we are
said to be alone. And all hearts respond to
the truth of that saying, This is not solitude;
for sympathy can people our solitude with a
crowd. The fisherman on the ocean alone at
night is not alone, when he remembers the
earnest longings which are rising up to heaven
at home for his safety. The traveler is not
alone, when the faces which will greet him
on his arrival seem to beam upon him as he
trudges on. The solitary student is not alone,
when he feels that human hearts will respond
to the truths which he is preparing to address
to them.</p>

<p>The other is loneliness of soul. There are
times when hands touch ours, but only send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
an icy chill of unsympathizing indifference
to the heart; when eyes gaze into ours, but
with a glazed look which can not read into the
bottom of our souls; when words pass from
our lips, but only come back as an echo reverberated
without reply through a dreary solitude;
when the multitude throng and press
us, and we can not say, as Christ said, "Somebody
hath touched me"; for the contact has
been not between soul and soul, but only between
form and form.</p>

<p>And there are two kinds of men, who feel
this last solitude in different ways. The first
are the men of self-reliance&mdash;self-dependent&mdash;who
ask no counsel, and crave no sympathy;
who act and resolve alone, who can go sternly
through duty, and scarcely shrink, let what
will be crushed in them. Such men command
respect: for whoever respects himself constrains
the respect of others. They are invaluable
in all those professions of life in
which sensitive feeling would be a superfluity;
they make iron commanders, surgeons who do
not shrink, and statesmen who do not flinch
from their purpose for the dread of unpopularity.
But mere self-dependence is weakness;
and the conflict is terrible when a human sense
of weakness is felt by such men. Jacob was
alone when he slept on his way to Padan
Aram, the first night that he was away from
his father's roof, with the world before him,
and all the old broken up; and Elijah was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
alone in the wilderness when the court had
deserted him, and he said, "They have digged
down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with
the sword: and I, even I, only am left, and
they seek my life to take it away." But the
loneliness of the tender Jacob was very different
from that of the stern Elijah. To
Jacob the sympathy he yearned for was realized
in the form of a gentle dream. A ladder
raised from earth to heaven figured the possibility
of communion between the spirit of
man and the Spirit of God. In Elijah's case,
the storm, and the earthquake, and the fire
did their convulsing work in the soul, before
a still, small voice told him that he was not
alone. In such a spirit the sense of weakness
comes with a burst of agony, and the dreadful
conviction of being alone manifests itself
with a rending of the heart of rock. It is
only so that such souls can be taught that the
Father is with them, and that they are not
alone.</p>

<p>There is another class of men, who live in
sympathy. These are affectionate minds,
which tremble at the thought of being alone;
not from want of courage nor from weakness
of intellect comes their dependence upon
others, but from the intensity of their affections.
It is the trembling spirit of humanity
in them. They want not aid, not even countenance,
but only sympathy. And then trial
comes to them not in the shape of fierce struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but of chill and utter loneliness, when
they are called upon to perform a duty on
which the world looks coldly, or to embrace
a truth which has not found lodgment yet in
the breasts of others.</p>

<p>It is to this latter and not to the former
class that we must look, if we could understand
the spirit in which the words of the
text were pronounced. The deep humanity
of the soul of Christ was gifted with those
finer sensibilities of affectionate nature which
stand in need of sympathy. He not only gave
sympathy, but wanted it, too, from others.
He who selected the gentle John to be His
friend, who found solace in female sympathy,
attended by the women who ministered to
Him out of their substance&mdash;who in the trial
hour could not bear even to pray without the
human presence, which is the pledge and reminder
of God's presence, had nothing in
Him of the hard, merely self-dependent character.
Even this verse testifies to the same
fact. A stern spirit never could have said,
"I am not alone: the Father is with me";
never would have felt the loneliness which
needed the balancing truth. These words tell
of a struggle, an inward reasoning, a difficulty
and a reply, a sense of solitude&mdash;"I shall be
alone"; and an immediate correction of that:
"Not alone: the Father is with me."</p>

<p>There is no thought connected with the
life of Christ more touching, none that seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
so peculiarly to characterize His spirit, as
the solitariness in which He lived. Those
who understood Him best only understood
Him half. Those who knew Him best scarcely
could be said to know Him. On this occasion
the disciples thought, Now we do understand,
now we do believe. The lonely spirit answered,
"Do ye now believe? Behold the hour
cometh that ye shall be scattered, every man
to his own, and shall leave me alone."</p>

<p>Very impressive is that trait in His history.
He was in this world alone.</p>

<p>I. First, then, we meditate on the loneliness
of Christ.</p>

<p>The loneliness of Christ was caused by the
divine elevation of His character. His infinite
superiority severed Him from sympathy; His
exquisite affectionateness made that want of
sympathy a keen trial.</p>

<p>There is a second-rate greatness which the
world can comprehend. If we take two who
are brought into direct contrast by Christ
Himself, the one the type of human, the other
that of divine excellence, the Son of Man and
John the Baptist, this becomes clearly manifest.
John's life had a certain rude, rugged
goodness, on which was written, in characters
which required no magnifying-glass to read,
spiritual excellence. The world, on the whole,
accepted him. Pharisees and Sadducees went
to his baptism. The people idolized him as a
prophet; and, if he had not chanced to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the path of a weak prince and a revengeful
woman, we can see no reason why John might
not have finished his course with joy, recognized
as irreproachable. If we inquire why it
was that the world accepted John and rejected
Christ, one reply appears to be, that the life
of the one was infinitely simple and one-sided,
that of the other divinely complex. In physical
nature, the naturalist finds no difficulty
in comprehending the simple structure of the
lowest organizations of animal life, where one
uniform texture, and one organ performing
the office of brain and heart and lungs, at
once, leave little to perplex. But when he
comes to study the complex anatomy of men,
he has the labor of a lifetime before him. It
is not difficult to master the constitution of
a single country; but when you try to understand
the universe, you find infinite appearances
of contradiction: law opposed by law;
motion balanced by motion; happiness blended
with misery; and the power to elicit a divine
order and unity out of this complex variety is
given to only a few of the gifted of the race.
That which the structure of man is to the structure
of the limpet, that which the universe is
to a single country, the complex and boundless
soul of Christ was to the souls of other men.
Therefore, to the superficial observer, His life
was a mass of inconsistencies and contradictions.
All thought themselves qualified to
point out the discrepancies. The Pharisees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
could not comprehend how a holy Teacher
could eat with publicans and sinners. His
own brethren could not reconcile His assumption
of a public office with the privacy which
He aimed at keeping. "If thou doest these
things, show thyself to the world." Some
thought He was "a good man"; others said,
"Nay, but he deceiveth the people." And
hence it was that He lived to see all that acceptance
which had marked the earlier stage
of His career&mdash;as, for instance, at Capernaum&mdash;melt
away. First, the Pharisees took the
alarm; then the Sadducees; then the political
party of the Herodians; then the people. That
was the most terrible of all: for the enmity
of the upper classes is impotent; but when
that cry of brute force is stirred from the
deeps of society, as deaf to the voice of reason
as the ocean in its strength churned into
raving foam by the winds, the heart of mere
earthly oak quails before that. The apostles,
at all events, did quail. One denied; another
betrayed; all deserted. They "were scattered,
each to his own": and the Truth Himself was
left alone in Pilate's judgment hall.</p>

<p>Now learn from this a very important distinction.
To feel solitary is no uncommon
thing. To complain of being alone, without
sympathy, and misunderstood, is general
enough. In every place, in many a family,
these victims of diseased sensibility are to be
found, and they might find a weakening satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in observing a parallel between their
own feelings and those of Jesus. But before
that parallel is assumed, be very sure that it
is, as in His case, the elevation of your character
which severs you from your species.
The world has small sympathy for divine
goodness; but it also has little for a great
many other qualities which are disagreeable
to it. You meet with no response; you are
passed by; find yourself unpopular; meet with
little communion. Well! Is that because
you are above in the world&mdash;nobler, devising
and executing grand plans, which they can not
comprehend; vindicating the wronged; proclaiming
and living on great principles; offending
it by the saintliness of your purity,
and the unworldliness of your aspirations?
Then yours is the loneliness of Christ. Or is
it that you are wrapped up in self, cold, disobliging,
sentimental, indifferent about the
welfare of others, and very much astonished
that they are not deeply interested in you?
You must not use these words of Christ. They
have nothing to do with you.</p>

<p>Let us look at one or two of the occasions
on which this loneliness was felt.</p>

<p>The first time was when He was but twelve
years old, when His parents found Him in the
temple, hearing the doctors and asking them
questions. High thoughts were in the Child's
soul: expanding views of life; larger views
of duty, and His own destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a moment in every true life&mdash;to
some it comes very early&mdash;when the old routine
of duty is not large enough; when the
parental roof seems too low, because the Infinite
above is arching over the soul; when the
old formulas, in creeds, catechisms, and articles,
seem to be narrow, and they must either
be thrown aside, or else transformed into living
and breathing realities; when the earthly
father's authority is being superseded by the
claims of a Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>That is a lonely, lonely moment, when the
young soul first feels God&mdash;when this earth
is recognized as an "awful place, yea, the
very gate of heaven"; when the dream-ladder
is seen planted against the skies, and we wake,
and the dream haunts us as a sublime reality.</p>

<p>You may detect the approach of that moment
in the young man or the young woman
by the awakened spirit of inquiry; by a certain
restlessness of look, and an eager earnestness
of tone; by the devouring study of all
kinds of books; by the waning of your own
influence, while the inquirer is asking the
truth of the doctors and teachers in the vast
temple of the world; by a certain opinionativeness,
which is austere and disagreeable
enough; but the austerest moment of the
fruit's taste is that in which it is passing
from greenness into ripeness. If you wait in
patience, the sour will become sweet. Rightly
looked at, that opinionativeness is more truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
anguish; the fearful solitude of feeling the
insecurity of all that is human; the discovery
that life is real, and forms of social and religious
existence hollow. The old moorings
are torn away, and the soul is drifting, drifting,
drifting, very often without compass, except
the guidance of an unseen hand, into
the vast infinite of God. Then come the lonely
words, and no wonder. "How is it that ye
sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about
my Father's business?"</p>

<p>That solitude was felt by Christ in trial.
In the desert, in Pilate's judgment hall, in the
garden, He was alone; and alone must every
son of man meet his trial-hour. The individuality
of the soul necessitates that. Each
man is a new soul in this world: untried, with
a boundless "Possible" before him. No one
can predict what he may become, prescribe his
duties, or mark out his obligations. Each
man's own nature has its own peculiar rules;
and he must take up his life-plan alone, and
persevere in it in a perfect privacy with which
no stranger intermeddleth. Each man's temptations
are made up of a host of peculiarities,
internal and external, which no other mind
can measure. You are tried alone; alone you
pass into the desert; alone you must bear and
conquer in the agony; alone you must be
sifted by the world. There are moments
known only to a man's own self, when he sits
by the poisoned springs of existence, "yearning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for a morrow which shall free him from
strife." And there are trials more terrible
than that. Not when vicious inclinations are
opposed to holy, but when virtue conflicts with
virtue, is the real rending of the soul in twain.
A temptation, in which the lower nature
struggles for mastery, can be met by the
whole united force of the spirit. But it is
when obedience to a heavenly Father can be
only paid by disobedience to an earthly one;
or fidelity to duty can be only kept by infidelity
to some entangling engagement; or the
straight path must be taken over the misery
of others; or the counsel of the affectionate
friend must be met with a "Get thee behind
me, Satan":&mdash;Oh! it is then, when human advice
is unavailable, that the soul feels what
it is to be alone.</p>

<p>Once more: the Redeemer's soul was alone
in dying. The hour had come&mdash;they were all
gone, and He was, as He predicted, left alone.
All that is human drops from us in that hour.
Human faces flit and fade, and the sounds
of the world become confused. "I shall die
alone"&mdash;yes, and alone you live. The philosopher
tells us that no atom in creation touches
another atom; they all approach within a certain
distance; then the attraction ceases, and
an invisible something repels&mdash;they only seem
to touch. No soul touches another soul except
at one or two points, and those chiefly
external&mdash;a fearful and lonely thought, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
one of the truest of life. Death only realizes
that which has been fact all along. In the
central deeps of our being we are alone.</p>

<p>II. The spirit or temper of that solitude.</p>

<p>Observe its grandeur. I am alone, yet not
alone. This is a feeble and sentimental way
in which we speak of the Man of sorrows.
We turn to the cross, and the agony, and the
loneliness, to touch the softer feelings, to
arouse compassion. You degrade that loneliness
by your compassion. Compassion! compassion
for Him! Adore if you will&mdash;respect
and reverence that sublime solitariness with
which none but the Father was&mdash;but no pity;
let it draw out the firmer and manlier graces
of the soul. Even tender sympathy seems out
of place.</p>

<p>For even in human beings, the strength that
is in a man can only be learnt when he is
thrown upon his own resources and left alone.
What a man can do in conjunction with others
does not test the man. Tell us what he can
do alone. It is one thing to defend the truth
when you know that your audience are already
prepossest, and that every argument
will meet a willing response; and it is another
thing to hold the truth when truth must be
supported, if at all, alone&mdash;met by cold looks
and unsympathizing suspicion. It is one
thing to rush on to danger with the shouts
and the sympathy of numbers; it is another
thing when the lonely chieftain of the sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
ship sees the last boat-full disengage itself,
and folds his arms to go down into the majesty
of darkness, crushed, but not subdued.</p>

<p>Such and greater far was the strength and
majesty of the Savior's solitariness. It was
not the trial of the lonely hermit. There is
a certain gentle and pleasing melancholy in
the life which is lived alone. But there are
the forms of nature to speak to him; and he
has not the positive opposition of mankind, if
he has the absence of actual sympathy. It is
a solemn thing, doubtless, to be apart from
men, and to feel eternity rushing by like an
arrowy river. But the solitude of Christ was
the solitude of a crowd. In that single human
bosom dwelt the thought which was to be
the germ of the world's life, a thought unshared,
misunderstood, or rejected. Can you
not feel the grandeur of those words, when
the Man, reposing on His solitary strength,
felt the last shadow of perfect isolation pass
across His soul:&mdash;"My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>Next, learn from these words self-reliance.
"Ye shall leave me alone." Alone, then, the
Son of Man was content to be. He threw
Himself on His own solitary thought: did not
go down to meet the world; but waited, tho
it might be for ages, till the world should
come round to Him. He appealed to the future,
did not aim at seeming consistent, left His
contradictions unexplained: I came from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Father: I leave the world, and go to the
Father. "Now," said they, "Thou speakest
no proverb"; that is enigma. But many a
hard and enigmatical saying before He had
spoken, and He left them all. A thread runs
through all true acts, stringing them together
into one harmonious chain: but it is not for
the Son of God to be anxious to prove their
consistency with each other.</p>

<p>This is self-reliance, to repose calmly on the
thought which is deepest in our bosoms, and
be unmoved if the world will not accept it yet.
To live on your own convictions against the
world, is to overcome the world&mdash;to believe
that what is truest in you is true for all: to
abide by that, and not be over-anxious to be
heard or understood, or sympathized with,
certain that at last all must acknowledge the
same, and that, while you stand firm, the
world will come round to you, that is independence.
It is not difficult to get away into
retirement, and there live upon your own convictions;
nor is it difficult to mix with men,
and follow their convictions; but to enter into
the world, and there live out firmly and fearlessly
according to your own conscience&mdash;that
is Christian greatness.</p>

<p>There is a cowardice in this age which is
not Christian. We shrink from the consequences
of truth. We look round and cling
dependently. We ask what men will think;
what others will say; whether they will stare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in astonishment. Perhaps they will; but he
who is calculating that will accomplish nothing
in this life. The Father&mdash;the Father
which is with us and in us&mdash;what does He
think? God's work can not be done without
a spirit of independence. A man has got some
way in the Christian life when he has learned
to say humbly, and yet majestically, "I dare
to be alone."</p>

<p>Lastly, remark the humility of this loneliness.
Had the Son of Man simply said, I can
be alone, He would have said no more than
any proud, self-relying man can say; but when
He added, "because the Father is with me,"
that independence assumed another character,
and self-reliance became only another form of
reliance upon God. Distinguish between genuine
and spurious humility. There is a false
humility which says, "It is my own poor
thought, and I must not trust it. I must distrust
my own reason and judgment, because
they are my own. I must not accept the dictates
of my own conscience; for is it not my
own, and is not trust in self the great fault
of our fallen nature?"</p>

<p>Very well. Now, remember something else.
There is a Spirit which beareth witness in our
spirits; there is a God who "is not far from
any one of us"; there is a "Light which lighteth
every man which cometh into the world."
Do not be unnaturally humble. The thought
of your own mind perchance is the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of God. To refuse to follow that may be to
disown God. To take the judgment and conscience
of other men to live by, where is the
humility of that? From whence did their
conscience and judgment come? Was the
fountain from which they drew exhausted for
you? If they refused like you to rely on their
own conscience, and you rely upon it, how are
you sure that it is more the mind of God than
your own which you have refused to hear?</p>

<p>Look at it in another way. The charm of
the words of great men&mdash;those grand sayings
which are recognized as true as soon as heard&mdash;is
this, that you recognize them as wisdom
which passed across your own mind. You feel
that they are your own thoughts come back
to you, else you would not at once admit them:
"All that floated across me before, only I
could not say it, and did not feel confident
enough to assert it, or had not conviction
enough to put into words." Yes, God spoke
to you what He did to them: only they believed
it, said it, trusted the Word within
them, and you did not. Be sure that often
when you say, "It is only my own poor
thought, and I am alone," the real correcting
thought is this, "Alone, but the Father is
with me,"&mdash;therefore I can live by that lonely
conviction.</p>

<p>There is no danger in this, whatever timid
minds may think&mdash;no danger of mistake, if
the character be a true one. For we are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in uncertainty in this matter. It has been
given us to know our base from our noble
hours: to distinguish between the voice which
is from above, and that which speaks from
below, out of the abyss of our animal and selfish
nature. Samuel could distinguish between
the impulse&mdash;quite a human one&mdash;which
would have made him select Eliab out
of Jesse's sons, and the deeper judgment by
which "the Lord said, Look not on his countenance,
nor on the height of his stature,
for I have refused him." Doubtless deep
truth of character is required for this: for
the whispering voices get mixed together,
and we dare not abide by our own thoughts,
because we think them our own, and not
God's: and this because we only now and then
endeavor to know in earnest. It is only given
to the habitually true to know the difference.
He knew it, because all His blessed life long
He could say, "My judgment is just, because
I seek not my own will, but the will of him
who sent me."</p>

<p>The practical result and inference of all
this is a very simple, but a very deep one:
the deepest of existence. Let life be a life of
faith. Do not go timorously about, inquiring
what others think, and what others believe, and
what others say. It seems the easiest, it is the
most difficult thing in life to do this. Believe
in God. God is near you. Throw yourself
fearlessly upon Him. Trembling mortal, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is an unknown light within your soul, which
will wake when you command it. The day
may come when all that is human, man and
woman, will fall off from you; as they did
from Him. Let His strength be yours. Be
independent of them all now. The Father is
with you. Look to Him, and He will save you.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Roswell Dwight Hitchcock</span> was born
at East Machias, Maine, in 1817. To his
pulpit delivery, which was direct, fluent
and impressive, he brought the results of
profound Bible research. He was an
evangelical transcendentalist, and for
many years addressed large and cultured
congregations in New York City. As a
teacher he was clear and inspiring, particularly
in historical theology. In 1880
he was made president of the Union
Theological Seminary. His best-known
work is the "Complete Analysis of the
Bible." He died in 1887.</p>

<h4>ETERNAL ATONEMENT<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
whose names are not written in the book of life of
the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</em>.&mdash;Revelation
xiii., 8.</p></blockquote>


<p>My subject is the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world. My text is
Revelation xiii., 8, the precise import
of which is disputed; and I will therefore give
you the rival renderings. As we have been
used to it in the Authorized Version, it reads:
"Written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world." The
Anglican revisers, following the lead of
Alford, make no essential change: "Written
in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been
slain from the foundation of the world." The
American revisers, following the lead of
Bengel, De Wette, and many others, would
have it: "Written from the foundation of the
world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath
been slain." The American rendering makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the election eternal. The Anglican rendering
makes the atonement eternal.</p>

<p>The prevalent opinion no doubt has been
that the atonement is simply an historic fact,
dating back now some nineteen hundred
years; and that only the purpose of it is
eternal. But Johann Wessel, the great German
theologian, who died only six years after
Martin Luther was born, got hold of the idea
that not election only, but atonement also, is
an eternal act. And this, it seems to me, is
both rational and scriptural. Eternal election,
profoundly considered, requires eternal atonement
for its support. Both are eternal, as
all divine realities are eternal. If the passage
in Revelation were given up, we should still
have to deal with 1 Peter i., 19, 20, where the
Lamb is spoken of as foreknown before the
foundation of the world, but manifested at
the end of the times; eternal reality becoming
temporal fact. We should still have to deal
with John xvii., 24, which also carries back
into eternity the redeeming relationship between
the Father and the Son. Even on
Calvary, as temporal actuality, the Lamb slain
is only a figure of speech, and, of course, it
can be no more than a figure of speech as
eternal reality in the bosom of God. But
whether in time, or in eternity&mdash;whether on
Calvary or in the bosom of God, the figure
must stand for something. For us the meaning
is, and must be, that not election only, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
atonement also, is eternal. And so the relationship
of God to moral evil stands forth as
an eternal relationship. Not that evil is itself
eternal; but God always knew it and always
felt it. It may help our thinking in this
direction to remember that there is a sense in
which creation itself is eternal; not independently
eternal, but, of God's will, dependently
eternal.</p>

<p>There must nothing be said, or thought, in
mitigation of the ethical verdict against moral
evil. The hatefulness of it, no matter what its
chronology may be, is simply unspeakable.
Violated law is monstrous. Unmindfulness of
God, who has always been so mindful of us, is
mean. Never to pray, either in one's closet
or in one's family, is against all the proprieties.
Idolatry is childish and contemptible.
Profaneness of speech is scandalous. Neglect
of holy time is robbery. Disobedience to
parents is shameful. Murder is hideous. Unchastity
murders the soul, is indeed both
murder and suicide. And so of all the rest.
Theft, falsehood, and even inordinate desire
are abominable. Imagine a community, larger
or smaller&mdash;a family, a township, a state, or a
nation&mdash;where the Ten Commandments are
persistently trampled under foot, and you will
have imagined a community intolerable even
to itself. And if this be our human judgment,
what must the divine judgment be?
The more pure and righteous a moral being is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the more squarely he must antagonize, more
intensely he must hate, the more surely he
must punish impurity and unrighteousness.
Volcanic fire inside the globe, forked lightning
outside of it, are faint emblems of holy wrath.
Wrong doing is the one thing nowhere, and
never, to be either condoned or endured.
Physical accident, bodily sickness, financial
disaster, social bereavement, may all be pitied.
But when a thoroughly bad man stands revealed,
only lightning is logical. He that sows
the wind ought to reap the whirlwind. It was
a great philosopher who stood amazed at the
starry sky, and at the moral sense in man.
Well he might. There is no softness in the
midnight sky; only cold blue marble, and a
steady blaze that never relents, and is never
tired. You can not endure that blaze, you dare
not risk yourself out alone among those gleaming
orbs with a guilty secret in your bosom.
The universe is instinct with law that never
abdicates. Remorse is not repentance; and
even repentance washes out no stain. Self-forgiveness
is impossible. The trumpet is always
sounding; every day is a judgment-day;
and every one of us goes to the left. Gehenna
is the only logical goal of sin.</p>

<p>Nor should any attempt be made to get at
the genesis of moral evil. The beginning of it
is simply inconceivable. The whole thing is
a mystery and must be let alone. Moral evil
is not eternal; or there would be two infinities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Nor is it a creature of God; or God would be
divided against Himself. And yet it had the
divine permission, whatever that may be
imagined to have been. With every attribute
roused and alert&mdash;infinity of power, infinity
of wisdom, infinity of holiness&mdash;God stood by
and let evil enter. Angels revolted first,
somewhere among the stars. Mankind revolted.
Was evil really unavoidable in a
proper moral system? If so, immorality is not
immoral. Evil that is really essential to good
should not be considered evil. It would be
only the bitter bud of the fragrant blossom
and the luscious fruit. Or, putting it in
another form, will you say that God could not
have prevented evil? He certainly could have
prevented it. In Heaven to-day, what is the
security of saints and angels, of your own dear
sainted mother, of Gabriel himself, but God's
own grace constraining the will of every saint,
constraining the will of every seraph? What
is human sin but the abuse of human appetites,
of human passions, of human faculties,
in themselves all innocent? Study the lesson
of our Lord's temptation in the desert.
Certainly, He was not tempted as we are, by
inflamed appetites and passions, by impaired
and disordered faculties. But He possest all
these natural appetites, passions, and faculties;
and they were put to a real and a
tremendous strain. That "great duel," as
Milton calls it, was no sham fight; one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
other had to go down. Christ was gnawed
by hunger, but refused to eat. He saw what
might be done by a brilliant miracle towards
inaugurating His Jewish ministry, but refused
to work it. He saw the short, Satanic path to
Messianic dominion, but chose Gethsemane
and Calvary. Now the first Adam was just
as cool and just as innocent as the second
Adam. And, with more of grace to strengthen
him, he too might have stood. There was no
real necessity for that first human disobedience.
It was sheer, wanton, gratuitous, inexplicable
apostasy. Somewhat more of divine
constraint, and the catastrophe would certainly
have been averted. Call it non-prevention,
call it permission, call it anything you
please, somehow sin entered in spite of God's
hating it. It came knocking for admission,
and God's shoulder was not against the gate.
For some reason, or reasons, not revealed,
perhaps not revealable, God thought it best
not to put His shoulder against the gate. The
hateful and hated thing pushed through.
Ormuzd let in Ahriman. I thank the Persian
for these two words. They embody and
emphasize the historic dualism of good and
evil. The historic dualism, you will observe
I say; there is no other dualism. God is One;
and Master of all. The divine permission of
hateful and hated evil, when we fairly apprehend
it, is a tremendous statement, which
might well be challenged, were not the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
itself so undeniably a fact. This is as far as we
can go. Here we halt, with our bruised and
throbbing foreheads hard up against the granite
cliff.</p>

<p>Practically, historic sin finds relief in historic
redemption. Apparently, there was
little, if any, interval between the two. Sin
came, perhaps, with the noontide rest. "In
the cool of the day"&mdash;that same day, most
likely&mdash;the offended Lord came walking in the
garden. The colloquy had a sharp beginning,
but a mellow ending. The bitten heel would
finally crush the biting head. And the
struggle at once began. The Lord came down
very close to His erring, guilty, frightened
children. And they clung very closely to
Him. We are in great danger of underrating
that primitive economy of grace. The record
is very brief, and the Oriental genius of it
seems strange to us. But we see an altar
there; and it can have but one meaning. Ages
after, in all the nobler ethnic religions&mdash;Egyptian,
Indian, Persian, and Pelasgic&mdash;we encounter
echoes and survivals of that first
vouchsafement of revelation. In all the great
religions, we find one God; in all of them,
personal immortality, with retribution; in
most of them, divine triads; in two of them
at least, the resurrection of the body. If it
be true, as we may well believe, that Socrates
is now in Heaven, singing the new song, it is
because he sacrificed; and he sacrificed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whether he fully understood it or not,
because of that colloquy in the garden.
And if that sufficed for him, the Providence
of God is justified. Historic sin is fairly
matched, and overmatched, by historic redemption.</p>

<p>But the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world, suggests a far sublimer theodicy.
We are taken back behind the human ages,
behind all time, into awful infinite depths,
into the very bosom of the triune God. Theological
science recognizes two trinities, which
it calls economic and essential. The former
began with historic redemption, and kept pace
with it. Father, Son, and Spirit stood for law,
redemption, and regeneration. It was economic
trinity that suggested essential trinity.
But for the historic process, the question
might not have seemed worth asking, whether
God is one only, or three also, and the three
in one. The Hebrew mind, as represented by
Philo, was only just beginning to be trinitarian,
when Christ's life in the flesh compelled
the Hebrew mind, as represented by
Peter, Paul, and John, to a new theology.
After Pentecost, bald Unitarianism was anachronous.
Christian experience logically required
three divine persons, of one and the
same divine essence. Economic trinity required
essential trinity.</p>

<p>Essential trinity is anything but an arbitrary
conception of God. Wyclif taught it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Oxford as a necessary doctrine of reason.
Trinity is another name for the self-consciousness,
and self-communion, of God. Father,
Son, and Spirit are vastly more than the
revelation of God to man; they are the revelation
of God to Himself, and the intercourse
of God with Himself. They suggest infinite
fulness and richness of being. Our scientific
definitions of God do not amount to much.
At best, they formulate only very inadequate
conceptions of Him. It is assumed that these
scientific definitions of God take us farther
than the Biblical descriptions of God. We
had better not feel too sure of that. Attributes
in action may impart a better knowledge
than attributes abstractedly defined. Pictures
for children may be better than creeds and
catechisms. What we need is to see God in
the life both of nature, and of man. This the
Hebrew prophets enable us to do by their
anthropomorphic and anthropopathic pictures
of God. If you say the pictures are childish,
then I must say that we are children, all of us,
and had better be children. It is no real
scandal to science to be told, that "the eyes
of the Lord are in every place, beholding the
evil and the good"; that "the eyes of the
Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their cry"; that the Lord "smelled
a sweet savor" from Noah's altar; while
wicked men are consumed by "the breath of
his nostrils"; that "the voice of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon"; and He
"walketh upon the wings of the wind"; and
that at last, in the Messianic time, "the Lord
will make bare his holy arm in the eyes of
all the nations." God is not a mere aggregate
of attributes. He has a personality as distinct
and positive as yours and mine. But the
personality is infinite in all its outgoings.
God's being is a vast abyss which no plummet
has ever sounded. Imagine all you can of
boundless power, constantly at work; of
boundless intelligence, constantly at work; of
boundless passion, constantly at work: God is
all that, and immeasurably more than that.
What right has any one to say that God is
passionless? God Himself has never said it.
He is not passionless. Like the sun, He is all
aflame; He rejoices in the truth; He hates a
lie. He is pleased with what is right, and
displeased with what is wrong. Good men are
the apple of His eye; bad men His abomination
and His scorn. Rendered literally, "God
is a righteous Judge, and a God who is angry
every day."</p>

<p>But God is love. So says John in that
famous passage, over which the theologians
are still disputing, whether the meaning be
that love is only one of the divine attributes,
or is that very essence of God, into which
every other attribute may be resolved. Some
of the profoundest thinkers of our day accept
these three words of John, "God is love," as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the final definition of God. Sunshine striking
a teardrop may give us the seven colors of the
rainbow; but the seven colors are all one
blessed light. God creates, governs, judges,
punishes, pities, redeems, and saves; but love
is the root of all. It was love that created this
wonderous universe, to which science can set
no bounds. It was love that created angels,
tho some of them rebelled, and were "delivered
into chains of darkness." It was love that
created this human brotherhood, all of whom
have rebelled and gone astray. This rebellion
was permitted; but was rebellion all the same.
God feels it; and has always felt it. Absalom
has broken his father's heart; and we are
Absalom. The grand old King goes up over
Olivet weeping, with his head covered, and his
feet bare; and that King is God. Only He is
the King Eternal, and His agony over sin is
also eternal. This agony of God over human sin
is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
world. God Himself atones, to Himself
atones; and so atonement is both eternal and
divine.</p>

<p>In that matchless epitome of the gospel&mdash;that
parable of the Prodigal Son, reported
only by Luke&mdash;not a word is said, not a glimpse
is given, of the father of the prodigal during
all that interval between the departure and
return. A veil is drawn over all those bitter,
weary years. So has God yearned and suffered
in the silent depths of His own eternity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
waiting and watching for the repentant
prodigal. This yearning, grieved, and suffering
God is the God and Father of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ; Son of God, Son of
Mary. This sinless Child should have had no
griefs of His own. His sorrows could have
been only those old eternal shadows of permitted
sin. The cross on which He died, flinging
out its arms as if to embrace the world,
lifted up its head toward the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world. Our hearts now
go back to Calvary; and from Calvary they go
up to God.</p>

<p>One word more. This stupendous idea of
eternal atonement carries with it the idea of
universal atonement. Whatever it was, and is,
must needs have been infinite. No magnitude
of sin, no multitude of sinners, can bankrupt
its treasury of grace. "God so loved the
world," is its everlasting refrain. "He that
will, let him take of the water of life freely."
"Take" is the word, my hearers. Let us
remember this. There is something for us to
do. God Himself can not pardon an impenitent
offender. If pardon were offered, it could
not be accepted. It is a law of our own being,
that we must repent. O Lamb of God, slain
so long ago, save us at last, when Thou comest
in the clouds; and save us here to-day.</p>

<p>It is one of the revelations of Scripture
that we are to judge the angels, sitting above
them on the shining heights. It may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be so. Those angels are the imperial guard,
doing easy duty at home. We are the "tenth
legion," marching in from the swamps and
forests of the far-off frontier; scarred and
battered, but victorious over death and sin.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles Kingsley</span> was born at Holne
Vicarage, Devonshire, in 1819. He was
by temperament enthusiastic, impetuous,
and great-hearted. His utterances were
notable for their unusual earnestness. "I
go at what I am about," he said, "as if
there were nothing else in the world for
the time being." In this way he completely
lost himself in the work in hand.
His favorite motto was "Be strong!" He
had a poetic spirit, and was both vigorous
and brilliant. He is known not only for
his sermons and addresses, but also for
his novels and some verse. He died in
1875.</p>

<h2>KINGSLEY</h2>

<h3>1819-1875</h3>

<h4>THE SHAKING OF THE HEAVENS AND
THE EARTH</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth
the removing of those things that are shaken, as of
things that are made, that those things which can not
be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a
kingdom which can not be moved, let us have grace,
whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence
and godly fear: for our God is a consuming fire.</em>&mdash;Hebrews
xii., 26-29.</p></blockquote>


<p>This is one of the royal texts of Scripture.
It is inexhaustible, like the God who
inspired it. It has fulfilled itself again
and again, at different epochs. It fulfilled itself
specially and notoriously in the first century.
But it fulfilled itself again in the fifth
century; and again at the Crusades; and
again at the Reformation in the sixteenth century.
And it may be that it is fulfilling itself
at this very day; that in this century, both
in the time of our fathers and in our own,
the Lord has been shaking the heavens and
the earth, that those things which can be
shaken may be removed, as things that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
made, while those things which can not be
shaken remain.</p>

<p>All confess this to be true, each in his own
words. They talk of this age as one of change;
of rapid progress, for good or evil; of unexpected
discoveries; of revolutions, intellectual,
moral, social, as well as political. Our
notions of the physical universe are rapidly
altering, with the new discoveries of science;
and our notions of ethics and theology are
altering as rapidly. The era assumes a different
aspect to different minds, just as it
did the first century after Christ, according
as men look forward to the future with hope,
or back to the past with regret. Some glory
in the nineteenth century as one of rapid
progress for good; as the commencement of a
new era for humanity; as the inauguration of
a Reformation as grand as that of the sixteenth
century. Others bewail it as an age of rapid
decay; in which the old landmarks are being
removed, the old paths lost; in which we are
rushing headlong into skepticism and atheism;
in which the world and the Church are both
in danger, and the last day is at hand.</p>

<p>Both parties may be right; and yet both
may be wrong. Men have always talked thus,
at great crises in the world's life. They talked
thus in the first century; and in the fifth,
and in the eleventh; and again in the sixteenth;
and then both parties were partially
right and partially wrong; and so they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
be now. What they meant to say, what they
wanted to say, what we mean and want to
say, has been said already for us in far deeper,
wider, and more accurate words, by him who
wrote this wonderful Epistle to the Hebrews,
when he told the Jews of his time that the
Lord was shaking the heavens and the earth,
that those things which were shaken might
be removed, as things that are made&mdash;cosmogonies,
systems, theories, prejudices, fashions,
of man's invention: while those things
which could not be shaken might remain, because
they were according to the mind and
will of God, eternal as that source from
whence they came forth, even the bosom of
God the Father.</p>

<p>"Yet once more I shake, not the earth only,
but also heaven."</p>

<p>How has the earth been shaken in our days;
and the heaven likewise. How rapidly have
our conceptions of both altered. How easy,
simple, certain, it all looked to our forefathers
in the middle age. How difficult, complex,
uncertain, it all looks to us. With increased
knowledge has come&mdash;not increased doubt:
that I deny utterly. I deny, once and for all,
that this age is an irreverent age. I say that
an irreverent age is one like the age of the
Schoolmen; when men defined and explained
all heaven and earth by &#224; priori theories, and
cosmogonies invented in the cloister; and
dared, poor, simple, ignorant mortals, to fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that they could comprehend and gauge the
ways of Him whom the heaven and the
heaven of heavens could not contain. This,
this is irreverence: but it is neither irreverence
nor want of faith, if a man, awed by the
mystery which encompasses him from the
cradle to the grave, shall lay his hand upon
his mouth, with Job, and obey the Voice which
cries to him from earth and heaven&mdash;"Be
still, and know that as the heavens are higher
than the earth, so are my ways higher than
thy ways, and my thoughts higher than
thine."</p>

<p>But it was all easy, and simple, and certain
enough to our forefathers. The earth, according
to the popular notion, was a flat
plane; or, if it were, as the wiser held, a
sphere, yet antipodes were an unscriptural
heresy. Above it were the heavens, in which
the stars were fixed, or wandered; and above
them heaven after heaven, each tenanted by
its own orders of beings, up to that heaven of
heavens in which Deity&mdash;and by Him, be it
always remembered, the mother of Deity&mdash;was
enthroned.</p>

<p>And if above the earth was the kingdom of
light, and purity, and holiness, what could be
more plain, than that below it was the kingdom
of darkness, and impurity, and sin?
That was no theory to our forefathers: it
was a physical fact. Had not even the heathens
believed as much, and said so, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
mouth of the poet Virgil? He had declared
that the mouth of Tartarus lay in Italy, hard
by the volcanic lake Avernus; and after the
unexpected eruption of Vesuvius in the first
century, nothing seemed more clear than that
Virgil was right; and that men were justified
in talking of Tartarus, Styx, and Phlegethon
as indisputable Christian entities. Etna,
Stromboli, Hecla, were (according to this cosmogony)
likewise mouths of hell; and there
were not wanting holy hermits, who had
heard from within those craters, shrieks, and
clanking chains, and the howls of demons
tormenting the souls of the endlessly lost.</p>

<p>Our forefathers were not aware that, centuries
before the incarnation of our Lord, the
Buddhist priests had held exactly the same
theory of moral retribution; and that painted
on the walls of Buddhist temples might be
seen horrors identical with those which
adorned the walls of many a Christian
church, in the days when men believed in
this Tartarology as firmly as they now believe
in the results of chemistry or of
astronomy.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;How is the earth shaken, and
the heavens likewise, in that very sense in
which the expression is used by him who
wrote to the Hebrews? Our conceptions of
them are shaken. How much of that medieval
cosmogony do educated men believe, in
the sense in which they believe that the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
angles of a triangle are equal to two right
angles, or that if they steal their neighbor's
goods they commit a sin?</p>

<p>The earth has been shaken for us, more and
more violently, as the years have rolled on.
It was shaken when astronomy told us that
the earth was not the center of the universe,
but a tiny planet revolving round a sun in
a remote region thereof.</p>

<p>It was shaken, when geology told us that
the earth had endured for countless ages, during
which continents had become oceans, and
oceans continents, again and again. And even
now, it is being shaken by researches into the
antiquity of man, into the origin and permanence
of species, which, let the result be
what it will, must in the meanwhile shake
for us theories and dogmas which have been
undisputed for 1500 years.</p>

<p>And with the rest of our cosmogony, that
conception of a physical Tartarus below the
earth has been shaken likewise, till good men
have been fain to find a fresh place for it in
the sun, or in a comet; or to patronize the
probable, but as yet unproved theory of a
central fire within the earth; not on any scientific
grounds, but simply if by any means they
can assign a region in space, wherein material
torment can be inflicted on the spirits of the
lost.</p>

<p>And meanwhile the heavens, the spiritual
world, is being shaken no less. More and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
more frequently, more and more loudly, men
are asking, not skeptics merely, but pious men,
men who wish to be, and who believe themselves
to be, orthodox Christians, more and
more loudly are such men asking questions
which demand an answer, with a learning and
an eloquence, as well as with a devoutness and
a reverence for Scripture, which&mdash;whether
rightly or wrongly employed&mdash;is certain to
command attention.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, these men are asking,
whether the actual and literal words of Scripture
really involve the medieval theory of an
endless Tartarus.</p>

<p>They are saying, "It is not we who deny,
but you who assert, endless torments, who are
playing fast and loose with the letter of Scripture.
You are reading into it conceptions borrowed
from Virgil, Dante, Milton, when you
translate into the formula 'endless torment'
such phrases as 'the outer darkness,' 'the fire
of Gehenna,' the 'worm that dieth not';
which, according to all just laws of interpretation,
refer not to the next life, but to this
life, and specially to the approaching catastrophe
of the Jewish nation; or when you say
that eternal death really means eternal life&mdash;only
life in torture."</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, they are saying this;
and then they add, "We do not yield to you
in love and esteem for Scripture. We demand
not a looser, but a stricter; not a more metaphoric,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
but a more literal; not a more contemptuous,
but a more reverent interpretation
thereof."</p>

<p>So these men speak, rightly or wrongly.
And for good or for evil, they will be heard.</p>

<p>And with these questions others have arisen,
not new at all, say these men, but to be found
amid many contradictions, in the writings of
all the best divines, when they have given up
for a moment systems and theories, and listened
to the voice of their own hearts; questions
natural enough to an age which abhors
cruelty, has abolished torture, labors for the
reformation of criminals, and debates, rightly
or wrongly, about abolishing capital punishment.
Men are asking questions about the
heaven, the spiritual world, and saying, "The
spiritual world? Is it only another material
world which happens to be invisible now, but
which may become visible hereafter: or is it
not rather the moral world&mdash;the world of
right and wrong? Heaven? Is not the true
and real heaven the kingdom of love, justice,
purity, beneficence? Is not that the eternal
heaven wherein God abides for ever, and with
Him those who are like God? And hell? Is
it not rather the anarchy of hate, injustice,
impurity, uselessness; wherein abides all that
is opposed to God?"</p>

<p>And with these thoughts come others about
moral retribution&mdash;"What is its purpose?
Can it, can any punishment have any right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
purpose save the correction, or the annihilation,
of the criminal? Can God, in this respect,
be at once less merciful and less powerful
than men? Is He so controlled by necessity
that He is forced to bring into the world
beings whom he knows to be incorrigible, and
doomed to endless misery? And if not so controlled,
is not the alternative as to His character
even more fearful? He bids us copy
His justice, His love. Is that His justice, that
His love, which if we copied, we should call
each other, and deservedly, utterly unjust and
unloving? Can there be one morality for
God, and another for man, made in the image
of God? Are these dark dogmas worthy of
a Father who hateth nothing that He hath
made, and is perfect in this, that He makes
His sun shine on the evil and on the good,
and His rain fall on the just and on the unjust,
and is good to the unthankful and to
the evil? Are they worthy of a Son who, in
the fire of His divine charity, stooped from
heaven to earth, to toil, to suffer, to die on the
cross, that the world by Him might be saved?
Are they worthy of that which proceeds from
the Father and the Son, even that Spirit of
boundless charity, and fervent love, by which
the Son offered Himself to the Father, a sacrifice
for the sins of the world&mdash;and surely not
in vain?"</p>

<p>So men are asking, rightly or wrongly; and
they are guarding themselves, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
time, from the imputation of disbelief in
moral retribution; of fancying God to be a
careless, epicurean deity, cruelly indulgent to
sin, and therefore, in so far, immoral.</p>

<p>They say&mdash;"We believe firmly enough in
moral retribution. How can we help believing
in it, while we see it working around us,
in many a fearful shape, here, now, in this
life? And we believe that it may work on,
in still more fearful shapes, in the life to come.
We believe that as long as a sinner is impenitent,
he must be miserable; that if he goes
on impenitent for ever, he must go on making
himself miserable, aye, it may be more and
more miserable for ever. Only do not tell
us that he must go on. That his impenitence,
and therefore his punishment, is irremediable,
necessary, endless; and thereby destroy the
whole purpose, and we should say, the whole
morality, of his punishment. If that punishment
be corrective, our moral sense is not
shocked by any severity, by any duration: but
if it is irremediable, it can not be corrective;
and then, what it is, or why it is, we can not&mdash;or
rather dare not&mdash;say. We, too, believe in
an eternal fire. But because we believe also
the Athanasian Creed, which tells us that
there is but one eternal, we believe that that
fire must be the fire of God, and therefore,
like all that is in God and of God, good and
not evil, a blessing and not a curse. We believe
that that fire is for ever burning, tho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
men are for ever trying to quench it all day
long; and that it has been and will be in
every age burning up all the chaff and stubble
of man's inventions; the folly, the falsehood,
the ignorance, the vice of this sinful world;
and we praise God for it; and give thanks to
Him for His great glory, that He is the everlasting
and triumphant foe of evil and misery,
of whom it is written, that our God is a consuming
fire."</p>

<p>Such words are being spoken, right or
wrong. Such words will bear their fruit, for
good or evil. I do not pronounce how much
of them is true or false. It is not my place
to dogmatize and define, where the Church of
England, as by law established, has declined
to do so. Neither is it for you to settle these
questions. It is rather a matter for your
children. A generation more, it may be, of
earnest thought will be required, ere the true
answer has been found. But it is your duty,
if you be educated and thoughtful persons,
to face these questions; to consider whether
you are believing the exact words of the Bible,
and the conclusions of your own reason and
moral sense; or whether you are merely believing
that cosmogony elaborated in the cloister,
that theory of moral retribution pardonable
in the middle age, which Dante and Milton
sang.</p>

<p>But this I do not hesitate to say, That if
we of the clergy can find no other answers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
these doubts than those which were reasonable
and popular in an age when men racked
women, burned heretics, and believed that
every Mussulman killed in a crusade went
straight to Tartarus, then very serious times
are at hand, both for the Christian clergy and
for Christianity itself.</p>

<p>What, then, are we to believe and do? Shall
we degenerate into a lazy skepticism, which
believes that everything is a little true, and
everything a little false&mdash;in plain words, believes
nothing at all? Or shall we degenerate
into faithless fears, and unmanly wailings
that the flood of infidelity is irresistible, and
that Christ has left His Church?</p>

<p>We shall do neither, if we believe the text.
That tells us of a firm standing ground amid
the wreck of fashions and opinions; of a
kingdom which can not be moved, tho the
heavens pass away like a scroll, and the earth
be burnt up with a fervent heat.</p>

<p>And it tells us that the King of that kingdom
is He, who is called Jesus Christ&mdash;the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</p>

<p>An eternal and changeless kingdom, and
an eternal and changeless King&mdash;these the
Epistle to the Hebrews preaches to all generations.</p>

<p>It does not say that we have an unchangeable
cosmogony, an unchangeable eschatology,
an unchangeable theory of moral retribution,
an unchangeable dogmatic system; not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
these does it point the Jews, while their own
nation and worship were in their very death-agony,
and the world was rocking and reeling
round them, decay and birth going on side by
side, in a chaos such as man had never seen
before. Not to these does the epistle point
the Hebrews: but to the changeless kingdom
and to the changeless King.</p>

<p>My friends, do you really believe in that
kingdom, and in that King? Do you believe
that you are now actually in a kingdom of
heaven, which can not be moved; and that the
living, acting, guiding, practical, real King
thereof is Christ who died on the cross?</p>

<p>These are days in which a preacher is bound
to ask his congregation&mdash;and still more to ask
himself&mdash;whether he really believes in that
kingdom, and in that King; and to bid himself
and them, if they have not believed earnestly
enough therein, to repent of having
neglected that most cardinal doctrine of
Scripture and of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>But if we really believe in that changeless
kingdom and in that changeless King, shall we
not&mdash;considering who Christ is, the coequal
and coeternal Son of God&mdash;believe also, that
if the heavens and the earth are being shaken,
then Christ Himself may be shaking them?
That if opinions be changing, then Christ
Himself may be changing them? That if new
truths are being discovered, Christ Himself
may be revealing them? That if some of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
truths seem to contradict those which He has
revealed already, they do not really contradict
them? That, as in the sixteenth century,
Christ is burning up the wood and stubble
with which men have built on His foundation,
that the pure gold of His truth may alone be
left? It is at least possible; it is probable, if
we believe that Christ is a living, acting King,
to whom all power is given in heaven and
earth, and who is actually exercising that
power; and educating Christendom, and
through Christendom the whole human race,
to a knowledge of Himself, and through Himself
of God their Father in heaven.</p>

<p>Should we not say&mdash;We know that Christ
has been so doing, for centuries and for ages?
Through Abraham, through Moses, through
the prophets, through the Greeks, through the
Romans, and at last through Himself, He gave
men juster and wider views of themselves, of
the universe, and of God. And even then He
did not stop. How could He, who said of
Himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work"? How could He, if He be the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever? Through
the apostles, and especially through St. Paul,
He enlarged, while He confirmed, His own
teaching. And did He not do the same in the
sixteenth century? Did He not then sweep
from the minds and hearts of half Christendom
beliefs which had been sacred and indubitable
for a thousand years? Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
He not be doing so now? If it be answered,
that the Reformation of the sixteenth century
was only a return to simpler and purer apostolic
truth&mdash;why, again, should it not be so
now? Why should He not be perfecting His
work one step more, and sweeping away more
of man's inventions, which are not integral
and necessary elements of the one catholic
faith, but have been left behind, in pardonable
human weakness, by our great reformers?
Great they were, and good: giants on the
earth, while we are but as dwarfs beside them.
But, as the hackneyed proverb says, the dwarf
on the giant's shoulders may see further than
the giant himself: and so may we.</p>

<p>Oh! that men would approach new truth in
something of that spirit; in the spirit of reverence
and godly fear, which springs from a
living belief in Christ the living King, which
is&mdash;as the text tells us&mdash;the spirit in which
we can serve God acceptably. Oh! that they
would serve God; waiting reverently and
anxiously, as servants standing in the presence
of their Lord, for the slightest sign or
hint of His will. Then they would have
grace by which they would receive new-thought
with grace; gracefully, courteously,
fairly, charitably, reverently; believing that,
however strange or startling, it may come
from Him whose ways are not as our ways,
nor His thoughts as our thoughts; and that
he who fights against it, may haply be fighting
against God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>True, they would receive all new thought
with caution, that conservative spirit, which
is the duty of every Christian; which is the
peculiar strength of the Englishman, because
it enables him calmly and slowly to take in
the new, without losing the old which his
forefathers have already won for him. So
they would be cautious, even anxious, lest in
grasping too greedily at seeming improvements,
they let go some precious knowledge
which they had already attained: but they
would be on the lookout for improvements;
because they would consider themselves, and
their generation, as under a divine education.
They would prove all things fairly and boldly,
and hold fast that which is good; all that
which is beautiful, noble, improving and elevating
to human souls, minds, or bodies; all
that increases the amount of justice, mercy,
knowledge, refinement; all that lessens the
amount of vice, cruelty, ignorance, barbarism.
That at least must come from Christ. That
at least must be the inspiration of the Spirit
of God: unless the Pharisees were right after
all when they said, that evil spirits could be
cast out by the prince of the devils.</p>

<p>Be these things as they may, one comfort it
will give us, to believe firmly and actively in
the changeless kingdom, and in the changeless
King. It will give us calm, patience, faith
and hope, tho the heavens and the earth be
shaken around us. For then we shall see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the kingdom, of which we are citizens, is a
kingdom of light, and not of darkness; of
truth, and not of falsehood; of freedom, and
not of slavery; of bounty and mercy, and not
of wrath and fear; that we live and move and
have our being not in a "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus quidam deceptor</i>"
who grudges his children wisdom,
but in a Father of Light, from whom comes
every good and perfect gift; who willeth that
all men should be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth. In His kingdom we
are; and in the King whom He has set over
it we can have the most perfect trust. For
us that King stooped from heaven to earth;
for us He was born, for us He toiled, for us
He suffered, for us He died, for us He rose,
for us He sits for ever at God's right hand.
And can we not trust Him? Let Him do
what He will. Let Him lead us whither He
will. Wheresoever He leads must be the way
of truth and life. Whatsoever He does, must
be in harmony with that infinite love which
He displayed for us upon the cross. Whatsoever
He does, must be in harmony with that
eternal purpose by which He reveals to men
God their Father. Therefore, tho the heaven
and the earth be shaken around us, we will
trust in Him. For we know that He is the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; and
that His will and promise is, to lead those
who trust in Him into all truth.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">John Caird</span> was born at Greenock,
Scotland, in 1820. He attained great
popularity as a preacher in Edinburgh.
In 1862 he was called to Park Church,
Glasgow, and in 1873 became Principal
of Glasgow University. The sermon
given here was preached before the
Queen in 1855, and, printed by her command,
attained an amazing circulation.
Dr. Caird's deep and earnest thought was
clothed almost invariably in clear and
beautiful language. He had many gifts
as a pulpit speaker. His voice was full
and deep-toned, his manner gracious and
sympathetic, and his gestures, tho infrequent,
were always significant and graceful.
He died in 1898.</p>

<h4>RELIGION IN COMMON LIFE<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
Lord.</em>&mdash;Romans xii., 11.</p></blockquote>


<p>When a man is learning to be a Christian,
it matters not what his particular
work in life may be; the
work he does is but the copy-line set to him;
the main thing to be considered is that he
learn to live well. The form is nothing, the
execution is everything. It is true, indeed,
that prayer, holy reading, meditation, the
solemnities and services of the Church, are
necessary to religion, and that these can be
practised only apart from the work of secular
life. But it is to be remembered that all such
holy exercises do not terminate in themselves.
They are but steps in the ladder to heaven,
good only as they help us to climb. They are
the irrigation and enriching of the spiritual
soil&mdash;worse than useless if the crop become
not more abundant. They are, in short, but
means to an end&mdash;good, only in so far as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
help us to be good and to do good&mdash;to glorify
God and do good to man; and that end can
perhaps best be attained by him whose life is
a busy one, whose avocations bear him daily
into contact with his fellows, into the intercourse
of society, into the heart of the world.
No man can be a thorough proficient in navigation
who has never been at sea, tho he may
learn the theory of it at home. No man can
become a soldier by studying books on military
tactics in his closet: he must in actual
service acquire those habits of coolness, courage,
discipline, address, rapid combination,
without which the most learned in the theory
of strategy or engineering will be but a schoolboy
soldier after all. And, in the same way,
a man in solitude and study may become a
most learned theologian, or may train himself
into the timid, effeminate piety of what is
technically called "the righteous life." But
never, in the highest and holiest sense, can he
become a religious man, until he has acquired
those habits of daily self-denial, of resistance
to temptation, of kindness, gentleness, humility,
sympathy, active beneficence, which are
to be acquired only in daily contact with mankind.
Tell us not, then, that the man of
business, the bustling tradesman, the toil-worn
laborer, has little or no time to attend to
religion. As well tell us that the pilot, amid
the winds and storms, has no leisure to attend
to navigation&mdash;or the general, on the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
battle, to the art of war! Where will he attend
to it? Religion is not a perpetual moping over
good books&mdash;religion is not even prayer,
praise, holy ordinances; these are necessary to
religion&mdash;no man can be religious without
them. But religion, I repeat, is, mainly and
chiefly, the glorifying God amid the duties and
trials of the world,&mdash;the guiding our course
amid the adverse winds and currents of temptation,
by the starlight of duty and the
compass of divine truth,&mdash;the bearing us manfully,
wisely, courageously, for the honor of
Christ, our great Leader, in the conflict of
life. Away then with the notion that
ministers and devotees may be religious, but
that a religious and holy life is impracticable
in the rough and busy world! Nay rather, believe
me, that is the proper scene, the peculiar
and appropriate field for religion,&mdash;the place
in which to prove that piety is not a dream of
Sundays and solitary hours; that it can bear
the light of day; that it can wear well amid
the rough jostlings, the hard struggles, the
coarse contacts of common life,&mdash;the place, in
one word, to prove how possible it is for a man
to be at once "not slothful in business," and
"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord."</p>

<p>Another consideration, which I shall adduce
in support of the assertion that it is not impossible
to blend religion with the business of
common life, is this: that religion consists, not
so much in doing spiritual or sacred acts, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in doing secular acts from a sacred or religious
motive.</p>

<p>There is a very common tendency in our
minds to classify actions according to their
outward form, rather than according to the
spirit or motive which pervades them. Literature
is sometimes arbitrarily divided into
"sacred" and "profane" literature, history
into "sacred" and "profane" history,&mdash;in
which classification the term "profane" is applied,
not to what is bad or unholy, but to
everything that is not technically sacred
or religious&mdash;to all literature that does not
treat of religious doctrines and duties, and
to all history save church history. And we
are very apt to apply the same principle to
actions. Thus in many pious minds there
is a tendency to regard all the actions of
common life as so much, by an unfortunate
necessity, lost to religion. Prayer, the
reading of the Bible and devotional books,
public worship&mdash;and buying, selling, digging,
sowing, bartering, money-making, are separated
into two distinct, and almost hostile,
categories. The religious heart and sympathies
are thrown entirely into the former,
and the latter are barely tolerated as a bondage
incident to our fallen state, but almost
of necessity tending to turn aside the heart
from God.</p>

<p>But what God has cleansed, why should we
call common or unclean? The tendency in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
question, tho founded on right feeling, is
surely a mistaken one. For it is to be remembered
that moral qualities reside not in
actions, but in the agent who performs them,
and that it is the spirit or motive from which
we do any work that constitutes it base or
noble, worldly or spiritual, secular or sacred.
The actions of an automaton may be outwardly
the same as those of a moral agent,
but who attributes to them goodness or badness?
A musical instrument may discourse
sacred melodies better than the holiest lips can
sing them, but who thinks of commending it
for its piety? It is the same with actions as
with places. Just as no spot or scene on earth
is in itself more or less holy than another, but
the presence of a holy heart may hallow&mdash;or
a base one desecrate&mdash;any place where it
dwells; so with actions. Many actions, materially
great and noble, may yet, because of the
spirit that prompts and pervades them, be
really ignoble and mean; and, on the other
hand, many actions externally mean and
lowly, may, because of the state of his heart
who does them, be truly exalted and honorable.
It is possible to fill the highest station on
earth, and go through the actions pertaining
to it in a spirit that degrades all its dignities,
and renders all its high and courtly doings
essentially sordid and vulgar. And it is no
mere sentimentality to say that there may
dwell in a lowly mechanic's or household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
servant's breast a spirit that dignifies the
coarsest toils and "renders drudgery divine."
Herod of old was a slave, tho he sat upon a
throne; but who will say that the work of that
carpenter's shop at Nazareth was not noble
and kingly work indeed!</p>

<p>A life spent amidst holy things may be
intensely secular; a life, the most of which
is passed in the thick and throng of the
world, may be holy and divine. A minister,
for instance, preaching, praying, ever speaking
holy words and performing sacred acts,
may be all the while doing actions no more
holy than those of the printer who prints
Bibles, or of the bookseller who sells them;
for, in both cases alike, the whole affair may
be nothing more than a trade. Nay, the
comparison tells worse for the former, for the
secular trade is innocent and commendable,
but the trade which traffics and tampers with
holy things is, beneath all its mock solemnity,
"earthly, sensual, devilish."</p>

<p>So, to adduce one other example, the public
worship of God is holy work: no man can be
living a holy life who neglects it. But the
public worship of God may be&mdash;and with
multitudes who frequent our churches is&mdash;degraded
into work most worldly, most distasteful
to the great Object of our homage.
He "to whom all hearts be open, all desires
known," discerns how many of you have come
hither to-day from the earnest desire to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
communion with the Father of Spirits, to
open your hearts to Him, to unburden yourselves
in His loving presence of the cares and
crosses that have been pressing hard upon you
through the past week, and by common prayer
and praise, and the hearing of His holy Word,
to gain fresh incentive and energy for the
prosecution of His work in the world; and how
many, on the other hand, from no better
motive, perhaps, than curiosity or old habit,
or regard to decency and respectability, or the
mere desire to get rid of yourselves, and pass
a vacant hour that would hang heavy on your
hands. And who can doubt that, where such
motives as these prevail, to the piercing, unerring
inspection of Him whom outwardly we
seem to reverence, not the market-place, the
exchange, the counting-room appears a place
more intensely secular&mdash;not the most reckless
and riotous festivity, a scene of more unhallowed
levity, than is presented by the
house of prayer?</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, carry holy principles
with you into the world, and the world
will become hallowed by their presence. A
Christ-like spirit will Christianize everything
it touches. A meek heart, in which the altar-fire
of love to God is burning, will lay hold of
the commonest, rudest things in life, and
transmute them, like coarse fuel at the touch
of fire, into a pure and holy flame. Religion
in the soul will make all the work and toil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
life&mdash;its gains and losses, friendships, rivalries,
competitions&mdash;its manifold incidents and
events&mdash;the means of religious advancement.
Marble or coarse clay, it matters not much
with which of these the artist works, the touch
of genius transforms the coarser material into
beauty, and lends to the finer a value it never
had before. Lofty or lowly, rude or refined, as
our earthly work may be, it will become to a
holy mind only the material for something infinitely
nobler than all the creations of genius&mdash;a
pure and godlike life. To spiritualize
what is material, to Christianize what is secular&mdash;this
is the noble achievement of Christian
principle. If you are a sincere Christian, it
will be your great desire, by God's grace, to
bring every gift, talent, occupation of life,
every word you speak, every action you do,
under the control of Christian motive. Your
conversation may not always&mdash;nay, may
seldom, save with intimate friends&mdash;consist of
formally religious words; you may perhaps
shrink from the introduction of religious
topics in general society; but it demands a
less amount of Christian effort occasionally
to speak religious words, than to infuse the
spirit of religion into all our words; and if the
whole tenor of your common talk be pervaded
by a spirit of piety, gentleness, earnestness,
sincerity, it will be Christian conversation not
the less. If God has endowed you with
intellectual gifts, it may be well if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
directly devote them to His service in the
religious instruction; but a man may be a
Christian thinker and writer as much when
giving to science, or history, or biography, or
poetry, a Christian tone and spirit, as when
composing sermons or writing hymns. To
promote the cause of Christ directly, by
furthering every religious and missionary
enterprise at home and abroad, is undoubtedly
your duty; but remember that your duty terminates
not when you have done all this, for
you may promote Christ's cause even still
more effectually when in your daily demeanor&mdash;in
the family, in society, in your business
transactions, in all your common intercourse
with the world&mdash;you are diffusing the influence
of Christian principle around you by the
silent eloquence of a holy life. Rise superior,
in Christ's strength, to all equivocal practises
and advantages in trade; shrink from every
approach to meanness or dishonesty; let your
eye, fixed on a reward before which earthly
wealth grows dim, beam with honor; let the
thought of God make you self-restrained,
temperate, watchful over speech and conduct;
let the abiding sense of Christ's redeeming
love to you make you gentle, self-denying,
kind, and loving to all around you;&mdash;then indeed
will your secular life become spiritualized,
whilst, at the same time, your spiritual
life will grow more fervent; then not only will
your prayers become more devout, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the knee bends not, and the lip is silent, the
life in its heavenward tone will "pray without
ceasing;" then from amidst the roar and din
of earthly toil the ear of God will hear the
sweetest anthems rising; then, finally, will
your daily experience prove that it is no high
and unattainable elevation of virtue, but a
simple and natural thing, to which the text
points, when it bids us to be both "diligent in
business" and "fervent in spirit, serving the
Lord."</p>

<p>As a last illustration of the possibility of
blending religion with the business of common
life, let me call your attention to what may be
described as the mind's power of acting on
latent principles.</p>

<p>In order to live a religious life in the world,
every action must be governed by religious
motives. But in making this assertion, it is
not by any means implied that in all the
familiar actions of our daily life religion must
form a direct and conscious object of thought.
To be always thinking of God, and Christ, and
eternity amidst our worldly work, and, however
busy, eager, interested we may be in the
special business before us, to have religious
ideas, doctrines, beliefs, present to the mind,&mdash;this
is simply impossible. The mind can no
more consciously think of heaven and earth
at the same moment than the body can be in
heaven and earth at the same moment. Moreover
there are few kinds of work in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that, to be done well, must not be done
heartily, many that require, in order to
excellence, the whole condensed force and
energy of the highest mind.</p>

<p>But tho it be true that we can not, in our
worldly work, be always consciously thinking
of religion, yet it is also true that unconsciously,
we may be acting under its ever-present
control. As there are laws and powers
in the natural world of which, without thinking
of them, we are ever availing ourselves,&mdash;as
I do not think of gravitation when I move
my limbs, or of atmospheric laws when, by
means of them, I breathe, so in the routine of
daily work, tho comparatively seldom do I
think of them, I may yet be constantly swayed
by the motives, sustained by the principles,
living, breathing, acting in the invisible atmosphere
of true religion. There are under-currents
in the ocean which act independently
of the movements of the waters on the surface;
far down too in its hidden depths there is a
region where, even tho the storm be raging on
the upper waves, perpetual calmness and stillness
reign. So there may be an under-current
beneath the surface-movements of your life&mdash;there
may dwell in the secret depths of your
being the abiding peace of God, the repose of
a holy mind, even tho, all the while, the restless
stir and commotion of worldly business
may mark your outer history.</p>

<p>And, in order to see this, it is to be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that many of the thoughts and motives
that most powerfully impel and govern us in
the common actions of life, are latent thoughts
and motives. Have you not often experienced
that curious law&mdash;a law, perhaps, contrived
by God with an express view to this its highest
application&mdash;by which a secret thought or feeling
may lie brooding in your mind, quite
apart from the particular work in which you
happen to be employed? Have you never,
for instance, while reading aloud, carried
along with you in your reading the secret
impression of the presence of the listener&mdash;an
impression that kept pace with all the
mind's activity in the special work of reading;
nay, have you not sometimes felt the
mind, while prosecuting without interruption
the work of reading, yet at the same time
carrying on some other train of reflection apart
altogether from that suggested by the book?
Here is obviously a particular "business" in
which you were "diligent," yet another and
different thought to which the "spirit"
turned. Or, think of the work in which I am
this moment occupied. Amidst all the mental
exertions of the public speaker&mdash;underneath
the outward workings of his mind, so to speak,
there is the latent thought of the presence of
auditory. Perhaps no species of exertion requires
greater concentration of thought or
undividedness of attention than this: and yet,
amidst all the subtle processes of intellect,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
excogitation or recollection of ideas,&mdash;the
selection, right ordering and enunciation of
words, there never quits his mind for one
moment the idea of the presence of the listening
throng. Like a secret atmosphere, it surrounds
and bathes his spirit as he goes on with
the external work. And have not you too, my
friends, an Auditor&mdash;it may be a "great cloud
of witnesses,"&mdash;but at least one all-glorious
Witness and Listener ever present, ever watchful,
as the discourse of life proceeds? Why
then, in this case too, while the outward business
is diligently prosecuted, may there not be
on your spirit a latent and constant impression
of that awful inspection? What worldly
work so absorbing as to leave no room in a
believer's spirit for the hallowing thought of
that glorious Presence ever near? Do not say
that you do not see God&mdash;that the presence
of the divine Auditor is not forced upon your
senses as that of the human auditory on the
speaker. For the same process goes on in the
secret meditations as in the public addresses
of the preacher&mdash;the same latent reference to
those who shall listen to his words dwells in
his mind when in his solitary retirement he
thinks and writes, as when he speaks in their
immediate presence. And surely if the thought
of an earthly auditory&mdash;of human minds and
hearts that shall respond to his thoughts and
words can intertwine itself with all the
activities of a man's mind, and flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
back inspiration on his soul, at least as
potent and as penetrating may the thought
be, or Him, the great Lord of heaven and
earth, who not only sees and knows us now,
but before whose awful presence, in the last
great congregation, we shall stand forth to
recount and answer for our every thought and
deed.</p>

<p>Or, to take but one other example, have we
not all felt that the thought of anticipated
happiness may blend itself with the work of
our business hours? The laborer's evening
release from toil, the schoolboy's coming
holiday, or the hard-wrought business-man's
approaching season of relaxation&mdash;the expected
return of a long-absent and much-loved
friend&mdash;is not the thought of these, or similar
joyous events, one which often intermingles
with, without interrupting, our common
work? When a father goes forth to his "labor
till the evening," perhaps often, very often,
in the thick of his toils, the thought of home
may start up to cheer him. The smile that is
to welcome him, as he crosses his lowly threshold
when the work of the day is over, the glad
faces, and merry voices, and sweet caresses of
little ones, as they shall gather round him
in the quiet evening hours&mdash;the thought of all
this may dwell, a latent joy, a hidden motive,
deep down in his heart of hearts, may come
rushing in a sweet solace at every pause of
exertion, and act like a secret oil to smooth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
wheels of labor. And so, in the other cases
I have named, even when our outward activities
are the most strenuous, even when every
energy of mind and body is full strung for
work, the anticipation of coming happiness
may never be absent from our minds. The
heart has a secret treasury, where our hopes
and joys are often garnered&mdash;too precious to
be parted with even for a moment.</p>

<p>And why may not the highest of all hopes
and joys possess the same all-pervading influence?
Have we, if our religion be real, no
anticipation of happiness in the glorious
future? Is there no "rest that remaineth for
the people of God," no home and loving heart
awaiting us when the toils of our hurried day
of life are ended? What is earthly rest or
relaxation, what that release from toil after
which we so often sigh, but the faint shadow
of the saint's everlasting rest&mdash;the repose of
eternal purity&mdash;the calm of a spirit in which,
not the tension of labor only, but the strain of
the moral strife with sin, has ceased&mdash;the rest
of the soul in God! What visions of earthly
bliss can ever&mdash;if our Christian faith be not
a form&mdash;compare with "the glory soon to be
revealed"&mdash;what joy of earthly reunion with
the rapture of the hour when the heavens
shall yield our absent Lord to our embrace,
to be parted from us no more for ever! And
if all this be not a dream and a fancy, but
most sober truth, what is there to except this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
joyful hope from that law to which, in all
other deep joys, our minds are subject? Why
may we not, in this case too, think often,
amidst our worldly work, of the Home to which
we are going, of the true and loving heart that
beats for us, and of the sweet and joyous
welcome that awaits us there? And even when
we make them not, of set purpose, the subject
of our thoughts, is there not enough of
grandeur in the objects of a believer's hope to
pervade his spirit at all times with a calm
and reverential joy? Do not think all this
strange, fanatical, impossible. If it do seem
so, it can only be because your heart is in the
earthly hopes, but not in the higher and holier
hopes&mdash;because love to Christ is still to you
but a name&mdash;because you can give more ardor
of thought to the anticipation of a coming
holiday than to the hope of heaven and glory
everlasting. No, my friends! the strange
thing is, not that amidst the world's work
we should be able to think of our Home, but
that we should ever be able to forget it; and
the stranger, sadder still, that while the little
day of life is passing,&mdash;morning&mdash;noontide&mdash;evening,&mdash;each
stage more rapid than the last,
while to many the shadows are already fast
lengthening, and the declining sun warns them
that "the night is at hand, wherein no man
can work," there should be those amongst us
whose whole thoughts are absorbed in the
business of the world, and to whom the reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
never occurs that soon they must go out
into eternity&mdash;without a friend&mdash;without a
home!</p>

<p>Such, then, is the true idea of the Christian
life&mdash;a life not of periodic observances, or of
occasional fervors, or even of splendid acts of
heroism and self-devotion, but of quiet, constant,
unobtrusive earnestness, amidst the
commonplace work of the world. This is the
life to which Christ calls us. Is it yours?
Have you entered upon it, or are you now
willing to enter upon it? It is not, I admit,
an imposing or an easy one. There is nothing
in it to dazzle, much in its hardness and
plainness to deter the irresolute. The life of
a follower of Christ demands not, indeed, in
our day, the courage of the hero or the
martyr, the fortitude that braves outward
dangers and sufferings, and flinches not from
persecution and death. But with the age of
persecution the difficulties of the Christian
life have not passed away. In maintaining,
in the unambitious routine of humble duties,
a spirit of Christian cheerfulness and contentment&mdash;in
preserving the fervor of piety
amidst unexciting cares and wearing anxieties&mdash;in
the perpetual reference to lofty ends
amidst lowly toils&mdash;there may be evinced a
faith as strong as that of a man who dies with
the song of martyrdom on his lips. It is a
great thing to love Christ so dearly as to be
"ready to be bound and to die" for Him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
but it is often a thing not less great to be
ready to take up our daily cross, and to live
for Him.</p>

<p>But be the difficulties of a Christian life in
the world what they may, they need not discourage
us. Whatever the work to which our
Master calls us, He offers us a strength commensurate
with our needs. No man who
wishes to serve Christ will ever fail for lack
of heavenly aid. And it will be no valid
excuse for an ungodly life that it is difficult
to keep alive the flame of piety in the world,
if Christ be ready to supply the fuel.</p>

<p>To all, then, who really wish to lead such a
life, let me suggest that the first thing to be
done&mdash;that without which all other efforts are
worse than vain&mdash;is heartily to devote themselves
to God through Christ Jesus. Much
as has been said of the infusion of religious
principle and motive into our worldly work,
there is a preliminary advice of greater importance
still&mdash;that we be religious. Life comes
before growth. The soldier must enlist before
he can serve. In vain are directions how to
keep the fire ever burning on the altar, if first
it be not kindled. No religion can be genuine,
no goodness can be constant or lasting, that
springs not, as its primary source, from faith
in Jesus Christ. To know Christ as my
Savior&mdash;to come with all my guilt and weakness
to Him in whom trembling penitence
never fails to find a friend&mdash;to cast myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at His feet in whom all that is sublime in
divine holiness is softened, though not obscured,
by all that is beautiful in human
tenderness&mdash;and, believing in that love
stronger than death which, for me, and such
as me, drained the cup of untold sorrows, and
bore without murmur the bitter curse of sin,
to trust my soul for time and eternity into
His hands&mdash;this is the beginning of true
religion. And it is the reverential love with
which the believer must ever look to Him to
whom he owes so much, that constitutes the
mainspring of the religion of daily life.
Selfishness may prompt to a formal religion,
natural susceptibility may give rise to a fitful
one, but for a life of constant fervent piety,
amidst the world's cares and toils, no motive
is sufficient save one&mdash;self-devoted love to
Christ.</p>

<p>But again, if you would lead a Christian
life in the world, let me remind you that that
life must be continued as well as begun with
Christ. You must learn to look to Him not
merely as your Savior from guilt, but as the
Friend of your secret life, the chosen Companion
of your solitary hours, the Depositary
of all the deeper thoughts and feelings of your
soul. You can not live for Him in the world
unless you live much with Him, apart from
the world. In spiritual as in secular things, the
deepest and strongest characters need much
solitude to form them. Even earthly greatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
much more moral and spiritual greatness,
is never attained but as the result of much
that is concealed from the world&mdash;of many a
lonely and meditative hour. Thoughtfulness,
self-knowledge, self-control, a chastened wisdom
and piety, are the fruit of habitual meditation
and prayer. In these exercises heaven
is brought near, and our exaggerated estimate
of earthly things corrected. By these our
spiritual energies, shattered and worn by the
friction of worldly work, are repaired. In the
recurring seasons of devotion the cares and
anxieties of worldly business cease to vex us;
exhausted with its toils, we have, in daily
communion with God, "meat to eat which the
world knoweth not of;" and even when its
calamities and losses fall upon us, and our
portion of worldly good may be withdrawn,
we may be able to show, like those holy ones
of old at the heathen court, by the fair serene
countenance of the spirit, that we have something
better than the world's pulse to feed
upon.</p>

<p>But, further, in availing yourself of this
divine resource amidst the daily exigencies of
life, why should you wait always for the
periodic season and the formal attitude of
prayer? The heavens are not open to the
believer's call only at intervals. The grace of
God's Holy Spirit falls not like the fertilizing
shower, only now and then; or like the dew on
the earth's face, only at morning and night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
At all times on the uplifted face of the
believer's spirit the gracious element is ready
to descend. Pray always; pray without ceasing.
When difficulties arise, delay not to seek
and obtain at once the succor you need.
Swifter than by the subtle electric agent is
thought borne from earth to heaven. The
Great Spirit on high is in constant sympathy
with the believing spirit beneath, and in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the thrill
of aspiration flashes from the heart of man to
God. Whenever anything vexes you&mdash;whenever,
from the rude and selfish ways of men,
any trials of temper cross your path&mdash;when
your spirits are ruffled, or your Christian
forbearance put to the test, be this your
instant resource! Haste away, if only for a
moment, to the serene and peace-breathing
presence of Jesus, and you will not fail to
return with a spirit soothed and calmed. Or
when the impure and low-minded surround
you&mdash;when, in the path of duty, the high tone
of your Christian purity is apt to suffer from
baser contacts, oh, what a relief to lift the
heart to Christ!&mdash;to rise on the wings of faith&mdash;even
for one instant to breathe the air of
that region where the Infinite Purity dwells,
and then return with a mind steeled against
temptation, ready to recoil, with the instinctive
abhorrence of a spirit that has been beside
the throne, from all that is impure and vile.
Say not, then, with such aid at your command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that religion can not be brought down to common
life!</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me once more urge upon
you the great lesson on which we have been
insisting. Carry religious principle into
everyday life. Principle elevates whatever it
touches. Facts lose all their littleness to the
mind which brings principle and law to bear
upon them. The chemist's or geologist's soiled
hands are no sign of base work; the coarsest
operations of the laboratory, the breaking of
stones with a hammer, cease to be mechanical
when intellectual thought and principle govern
the mind and guide the hands. And religious
principle is the noblest of all. Bring
it to bear on common actions and coarse cares,
and infinitely nobler even than the philosophic
or scientific, becomes the Christian life. Live
for Christ in common things, and all your
work will become priestly work. As in the
temple of old, it was holy work to hew wood
or mix oil, because it was done for the altar-sacrifice
or the sacred lamps; so all your
coarse and common work will receive a consecration
when done for God's glory, by one who
is a true priest to His temple.</p>

<p>Carry religion into common life, and your
life will be rendered useful as well as noble.
There are many men who listen incredulously
to the high-toned exhortations of the pulpit;
the religious life there depicted is much too
seraphic, they think, for this plain and prosaic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
world of ours. Show these men that the
picture is not a fancy one. Make it a reality.
Bring religion down from the clouds. Apply
to it the infallible test of experiment; and,
by suffusing your daily actions with holy
principles, prove that love to God, superiority
to worldly pleasure, spirituality, holiness,
heavenly-mindedness, are something more
than the stock ideas of sermons.</p>

<p>Carry religious principle into common life,
and common life will lose its transitoriness.
"The world passeth away!" "The things
that are seen are temporal." Soon business
with all its cares and anxieties&mdash;the whole
"unprofitable stir and fever of the world"&mdash;will
be to us a thing of the past. But
religion does something better than sigh and
muse over the perishableness of earthly
things; it finds in them the seed of immortality.
No work done for Christ perishes. No
action that helps to mold the deathless mind
of a saint of God is ever lost. Live for
Christ in the world, and you carry with
you into eternity all of the results of the
world's business that are worth the keeping.
The river of life sweeps on, but the gold grains
it held in solution are left behind deposited
in the holy heart. "The world passeth away,
and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will
of God abideth for ever." Every other result
of our "diligence in business" will soon be
gone. You cannot invent any mode of exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
between the visible and invisible worlds, so
that the balance at your credit in the one can
be transferred, when you migrate from it,
to your account in the other. Worldly sharpness,
acuteness, versatility, are not the qualities
in request in the world to come. The
capacious intellect, stored with knowledge,
and disciplined into admirable perspicacity,
tact, worldly wisdom, by a lifetime devoted to
politics or business, is not, by such attainments,
fitted to take a higher place among the
sons of immortality. The honor, fame, respect,
obsequious homage that attend worldly
greatness up to the grave's brink, will not
follow it one step beyond. These advantages
are not to be despised; but if these be all that,
by the toil of our hand, or the sweat of our
brow, we have gained, the hour is fast coming
when we shall discover that we have labored
in vain and spent our strength for naught.
But while these pass, there are other things
that remain. The world's gains and losses
may soon cease to affect us, but not the
gratitude or the patience, the kindness or the
resignation, they drew forth from our hearts.
The world's scenes of business may fade on
our sight, the noise of its restless pursuits may
fall no more upon our ear, when we pass to
meet our God; but not one unselfish thought,
not one kind and gentle word, not one act of
self-sacrificing love done for Jesus' sake, in
the midst of our common work, but will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
left an indelible impress on the soul which
will go out with it to its eternal destiny. So
live, then, that this may be the result of your
labors. So live that your work, whether in the
Church or in the world, may become a discipline
for that glorious state of being in which
the Church and the world shall become one,&mdash;where
work shall be worship, and labor shall
be rest,&mdash;where the worker shall never quit
the temple, nor the worshiper the place of
work, because "there is no temple therein, but
the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
temple thereof."</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Richard S. Storrs</span> was born at Braintree,
Mass., in 1821. In his book "Preaching
Without Notes," he tells of his early
practise and experience in pulpit delivery.
After fifteen years patient effort he became
one of the most accomplished extemporaneous
speakers in America. He
wrote much at first, developing a fine
rhetorical style and a rich vocabulary that
subsequently served him well as an impromptu
speaker. His advice to divinity
students was: "Always be careful to keep
up the habit of writing, with whatever of
skill, elegance, and force, you can command."
Because of this early training in
writing he was able later in life to adopt
the method of thoroughly preparing his
thought for his sermons, and of leaving
the choice of words and the framing of
sentences to the moment of delivery. His
greatest success was achieved after he became
a purely extemporaneous preacher.
He was for fifty-four years pastor of the
Church of the Pilgrims, Brooklyn. During
this time he produced a number of
books, of which the most important is
"The Divine Origin of Christianity, Indicated
by its Historical Effects." He
died in 1900.</p>

<h2>STORRS</h2>

<h3>1821-1900</h3>

<h4>THE PERMANENT MOTIVE IN
MISSIONARY WORK</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to
every creature.</em>&mdash;Mark xvi., 15.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Permanent Motive in Missionary
Work: it is a catholic and comprehensive,
even a cosmopolitan theme. It
does not concern itself simply with the interest
of foreign missions, technically so
called. But, if you think of it, it concerns
those in every Christian communion who are
trying to further the cause and kingdom of
our Lord on the earth. It concerns not the
missionary fields alone, as they are popularly
called, in other lands, but every field in which
Christian service is sought to be rendered,
from the obscurest slum in this town of Boston
to the ragged edges of the circumference,
the outmost circumference, of the world of
mankind.</p>

<p>We are familiar, of course, with the temporary,
local, changing motives to missionary
enterprise, which meet us at times, impress us
forcibly for the moment, and pass away; the
influence of great and signal occasions, when
sympathies are almost tumultuously excited;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the impulse which comes with a sweeping eloquence,
which lifts us from the common levels
of earth, and bears us as on wings toward issues
and actions which we had not anticipated;
perhaps the impulse which comes with
personal interest in missionaries whom we
have known, or mission fields which we have
traversed. Great successes on certain fields
move our enthusiasm; or tragic and terrible
experiences in others, as recently among the
Armenians, stir the deep fountains of our
feeling. No one of these impulses is to be
disregarded. Each one in its place has a
power of its own, and all are to be valued and
welcomed for their effect. But what we are
to look for is the motive more deep, permanent,
governing, which will be beneath and
behind all these; as the tide-motive is beneath
and behind the advancing and retreating
waves which rise and flash, and break upon
the beach; and this will be a motive not simple
and single, but no doubt combined of several,
distinguishable from each other, as a powerful
current is made up of different uniting affluents.
We must separate them in thought,
that we may afterward combine them.</p>

<p>I think first, then, we shall all recognize
this as essential to the missionary motive: a
clear and profound recognition of the evilness
and misery of the actual condition of mankind,
certainly as compared with the powers
which are instinctive in every human soul. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
makes no difference really, or very little, at
this point, whether we accept the Scriptural
declaration that man has fallen from a higher
estate to his present level, or conceive, with
some modern theorizers, that man is just now
partially emerging from the conditions of his
brute ancestry, stumbling up, through sin and
error and manifold tremendous mistakes, toward
wisdom and virtue, and the blessedness
which they bring. In either case, the present
condition of mankind is one of imperfection,
weakness, unsatisfied desire, unrealized promise,
and manifold peril. It is not the missionary
who tells us this, principally or alone.
Every observant foreign traveler repeats the
same. Everyone who has resided abroad, and
then he comes back to testify with an unprejudiced
mind to that which he has observed,
relates the same. The supreme difficulty here
is in the want of the recognition of God, and
of the great immortality.</p>

<p>It used to be a reproach against Christian
scholars, made by skeptics, that they investigated
the ethnic religions in the spirit of suspicious
hostility, by which their processes were
diverted from true lines, by which their conclusions
were colored. I am not concerned
to argue the case of the Christian scholars of
fifty years ago, or more, but I can certainly
affirm that the Christian scholars of our own
time investigate these religions carefully,
patiently, sympathetically, with an eager desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to find everything in them that is of
beautiful worth; and they do find many
things of truth and beauty, many things which
excite their admiration, as illustrating the
attainment of the higher aspiration of the
human mind, reaching after the unseen if
haply it might find it. But they find nowhere
the discovery of one personal God, eternal in
authority, immaculate in character, creating
man in His own image, and opening before
him the ageless immensities beyond the grave;
and in the absence of such recognition of God,
and such recognition of the immortality, man
is left to grope where he can not fly, to clutch
the earth where he misses heaven. So it is
that industrially, politically, commercially,
socially, intellectually, he is on the lower level,
until some exterior power reaches and ennobles
him. So it is that crime, such as is
unknown in Christian communities, is familiar
and tolerated in the world. In fact, we
need not fix our thought, prominently, on the
more devilish crimes which still exist in parts
and portions of the earth,&mdash;cannibalism, infanticide,
human sacrifices, self-torture, the
slavery that would destroy body and soul together
in its own hell. Commoner vices have
told us the story sufficiently,&mdash;drunkenness,
licentiousness, the gambling passion, the
opium habit, the fierce self-will that rushes
to its end, regardless of anything sacred, in
order to attain its pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>All these we know. How familiar they are
to the mind, and in the life, of the world at
large! And there seems no power arising
within the circle not reached by Christian influence
to relieve the gloom, to elevate those
who are opprest by these sore burdens. There
<em>is</em> no power. Property asserts its right to
oppress, and to enjoy; poverty accepts its
function, however unwillingly, of suffering in
silence; the degradation of woman strikes a
vicious stab at the heart and conscience of
immense communities, while the oppression of
childhood blights life at its germ; and, with
the prospect of nothing better to come, suicide
becomes a common refuge from the unbearable
misery. There is nothing overstated in this
description of the world at large; and you
know how it is in your city slums, even in
this city of refinement and culture, I have
no doubt; certainly in the city in which I live;
in the London and Birmingham of the other
side, where the little girl twelve years old
had never heard the name of Christ, where
the boy of about the same age only knew the
nature of an oath by having been his lordship's
caddy. These are what we are to reach
and lift, if we can do it. These are they to
whom we are to bring blessings from the
Most High. Certainly, every heart in which
there is a spark of Christian sympathy must
feel the power of this motive, pressing to the
utmost and instant exertion of every force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to relieve the suffering, to enlighten the darkened,
and to lift the opprest.</p>

<p>No one need exaggerate, everyone should
recognize, the weakness and wretchedness, the
exposure and the peril of human society.
When we remember that in this universe of
ours destiny clings closely to character, has
never anything mechanical or arbitrary about
it, but follows the spirit which encounters it,
then those tremendous words of our Lord in
the twenty-fifth of Matthew have upon them
an appalling sharpness and reach, as addrest
to the great classes and companies of mankind;
and we must recognize it, and hear the
solemn bell of the universe ringing through
His word, and telling us of what is to be
looked for in the hereafter.</p>

<p>But then with this recognition of the exposure
and peril of human society, of mankind
at large, we must associate the recognition
of the recoverableness to truth, to virtue
and God, of persons and of peoples who are
now involved in these calamities and pains;
to whom, now, unrest and apprehension are
as natural as speech or sight; the recoverableness
of men as persons, and of communities as
well as persons.</p>

<p>Here, of course, we come into direct antagonism
with the pessimist, who says, "It
is all nonsense! You can't possibly do the
work; you can't take these ragged and soiled
remnants of humanity in your city streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and weave them into purple and golden garments
for the Master; you can not accomplish
the effect which you contemplate, in the cities,
in your own land, along the frontier, or in
other lands. It is as impossible to make the
unchaste pure, to make the mean noble, as it
is to make crystal lenses out of mud, or the
delicate elastic watch-spring out of the iron
slag!" That is the world's view, a common
and a hateful view. Our answer to it is that
the thing can be done, and has been done,
and done in such multitudes of instances that
there is no use whatever in arguing against
the fact. Christ came from the heavens to
the earth on an errand. He knew what was
in man; and He did not come from the celestial
seats on an errand known beforehand
to be fruitless and futile. He came because
He knew the interior, central, divine element
in human nature, to which He could appeal
and by which He could lift men toward things
transcendent. We have seen the examples of
success, how many times! Hundreds, yea even
thousands of times, in our own communities,
as missionaries have seen them in the lands
abroad: where the woman intemperate, in harlotry,
in despair, has been lifted to restored
womanhood, as the pearl oyster is brought up
with its precious contents from the slimy
ooze; where the man whose lips had been
charged with foulest blasphemies has become
the preacher of the gospel of light and love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of hope and peace, to others, his former comrades;
where the feet that were swift to do
evil have become beautiful on the mountains
in publishing salvation. We have seen these
things in individuals and in communities; in
the roughest frontier mining-camp, where
every door opened on a saloon or a brothel,
or a gambling-table, and where, by the power
coming from on high, it has been transformed
into the peaceful Christian village, with the
home, with the school, with the church, with
the asylum, with the holy song, where the former
customary music had been the crack of
revolvers. We have seen the same thing on
a larger scale in the coral islands, scenes of
savage massacre and of cannibal riot and
ferocity, where the Church has been planted,
and Christian fellowships have been established
and maintained. We have seen these
things, and why argue against facts?</p>

<p>Arguing against fact, as men ultimately
find out, is like trying to stop with articulate
breath the march of the stately battleship
as she sweeps onward to her anchorage. An
argument may meet a contrary argument;
no argument can overwhelm a fact. And
these facts in experience are as sure, as
difficult of belief perhaps, but as compulsive
of belief, as are the scientific demonstrations
of the liquid air, of the wireless telegraphy.
We do not question the reality of
what we see; and we know that these effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have been produced, on the smaller scale and
on the larger. I suppose that everyone who
has ever stood on the heights above Naples,
at the Church of San Martino, on the way to
St. Elmo, has noticed, as I remember to have
noticed, that all the sounds coming up from
that gay, populous, brilliant, fascinating city,
as they reached the upper air, met and
mingled on the minor key. There were the
voices of traffic and the voices of command,
the voices of affection and the voices of rebuke,
the shouts of sailors, and the cries of
itinerant venders in the street, with the chatter
and the laugh of childhood; but they all
came up into this incessant moan in the air.
That is the voice of the world in the upper air,
where there are spirits to hear it. That is
the cry of the world for help. And here is
the answer to that cry: a song of triumph
and glorious expectation, taking the place
of the moan, in the village, in the city, in the
great community; men and women out of
whom multitudes of devils have been cast, as
out of him of old, sitting clothed, and in their
right minds, at the feet of Jesus.</p>

<p>You can not tell me that it is impossible to
produce these effects, for mine own eyes have
seen them, mine own hands have touched
them. I know their reality, and that every
human soul which has not committed the final
sin and passed the judgment is recoverable
to God, if the right remedy be definitely applied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and that every people, however weak,
however sinful, however wanting in hope and
expectation, has within it the possibility, and
above it the promise, of the millennium. God's
power is adequate to all that. We want to
associate this idea of the recoverableness of
persons and of peoples to the highest ideal and
to God Himself; we want to combine this with
the idea of man's present misery and hopelessness
in his condition, to constitute the true and
powerful missionary motive; and then we
want to recognize the fact that the gospel of
Christ is the one force which, being used, secures
this result in the most unpromising
conditions.</p>

<p>Here, again, we encounter the opposition
of multitudes. How often men have laughed,
how loudly they have laughed, at the idea
that the story of the crucified Nazarene could
inspire a despondent soul to hope, could purify
the vicious soul into virtue, could bring
any soul nearer to God! Perhaps somewhere
they are laughing at it now; possibly even in
this city of Boston, the home of culture and
refinement, of fine and wide thought&mdash;I don't
know, I don't live here; but I know that in
the country at large there are always those
who are disposed to say, "It is perfectly
puerile to try to reach human sorrow and
human sin with the power of the gospel,
lodged in the little book which the child may
carry in her hand!" As if the inconspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
forces in the world's development were not
always those deadliest on the one hand, or
most benign on the other; as if wafts of air
did not kill multitudes more than all the batteries
of artillery; as if the unseen forces,
hardly manifesting themselves at all, were not
those which society seizes by which to advance
itself most rapidly and grandly&mdash;that little
spark, vanishing instantaneously, but revealing
the unseen force which drives machineries,
draws carriages, illuminates cities, and enables
you and me to talk as if face to face
with friends and correspondents at the distance
of a thousand miles; that fleecy vapor,
vanishing silently into the air but representing
the gigantic servant of modern civilization,
which tunnels mountains, scoops out
mines, and links the continents together with
iron bands. These unseen powers are the ones
that man craves and uses, or that, on the
other hand, he dreads and repels; and the
power of the gospel, however men may smile
at the idea of that power, has vindicated itself
too many times to be assailed by argument,
certainly too many times to be encountered
with ridicule.</p>

<p>The gospel is able to reconstitute society by
reconstructing the character of individuals.
Through its effect on persons it opens the way
for vast national advances. It touches not
merely the higher themes, but all the themes
that are associated with those, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
pertinent to the interest of mankind.
It teaches frugality and industry, and honesty,
by express command, and by the divine
example of Him who brought it to us. It
turns men, as has been forcibly said, "out of
the trails of blood and plunder into the path
of honest toil." It is a gospel for every creature,
that is, for every created thing; and gardens
bloom in a lovelier beauty under its influence,
and harvest festivals, of which the
country is full to-day, are only its natural and
beautiful fruit and trophy. It exalts womanhood;
and by the honor it puts on womanhood,
and by the honor it puts on childhood,
it inaugurates the new family life in the
world. It honors, as no other religion does
or ever did, the essential worth of the immortal
spirit in man; and it forces him, pushes
him, crowds him, into thoughtfulness and educational
discipline, since it will not allow him
to be manipulated into paradise by any
priestly hand, but comes to him in a Book,
and sets him to work to investigate its contents,
to inquire concerning it, to look out
widely around it, and to inform himself by
careful thought of what it is and what it
means.</p>

<p>There is the basis of colleges and theological
seminaries, and I hope there will be no quarrel
between them! There is the basis of all
the educational institutions and influences
that are worthy in the world. Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
brings them. It generates by degrees a new
social conscience. It unites communities, on
which it has operated, in new relationships
to each other. International alliances become
possible, become vital. International law becomes
a reality and a power; beneficence is
stimulated, and law becomes ethical. As we
have seen recently, in the prodigious excitement
of feeling throughout civilized countries
in consequence of the apparent gross injustice
done to a single French officer by a military
court, the time is coming, tho it has not
yet fully come, when mankind shall be one
in spirit, and an</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"... instinct bear along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the earth's electric circle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One swift flash of right or wrong."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not commerce which does this, it is
Christianity. We are witnesses to it. Our
ancestors, not many centuries ago, were mere
rapacious savages, robbers in the forests, pirates
on the sea; it was Christianity, brought
to them, that lifted them into gladness, serenity,
great purpose, great expectation and
hope; and the new civilization in which we
rejoice on either side, I will not say of the
separating, of the uniting ocean, was founded
on that New Testament, the folios of which,
I believe, are still preserved in Corpus Christi
College in Cambridge, and in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. Here is the basis of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
has been the grandest, most illustrious, and
most prophetic, in the recent history of mankind.
Give the gospel freedom and it will
everywhere show this power. Among the children
and youth to whom it goes, among the
mature and the strong, wheresoever it goes,
it grapples conscience, it stimulates the heart.
That one sentence, "The blood of Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin," is the profoundest
truth, is the most persuasive and commanding
appeal, ever addrest by an inspired apostle
to the children of mankind; and wherever that
is heard, sin is lost in penitence, and hope is
lost in triumphant vision, and the glory of
the world disappears before the glory immutable
of the Son of God!</p>

<p>Then we are to remember, certainly never
is this to be forgotten, that the great imperishable
motive, surpassing and dominating
every other in missionary effort, is adoring
love toward Christ, as central in the Scripture,
glorified in history. No student of history,
no observer of human experience, can fail
to see that there is the sovereign passion possible
to human nature; beside which the passion
of love for a friend, for a country, for
a business, for studies, may be auxiliary, but
must be subordinate. There is the passion
which has done the grandest things the world
has ever known. There is the passion the
vision of which interprets to us the strangest,
sublimest pages of history. We have all felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
it, I am sure, if we are Christian, in our measure,
and at times; at the sacrament, perhaps;
in those sabbaths of the soul of which Coleridge
speaks, when the mind eddies instead
of flowing onward; when we have been moved
to a great effort for Him whom we love; most
keenly, perhaps, when we have been in keenest
sorrow, when the earth was as iron under
our feet and the heavens as brass above our
head, and we were all alone, yet not alone,
for there stood beside us One in the form of
the Son of Man, making luminous the dark!
We have felt this love toward Christ; and
when we have felt it we have known that no
power could surpass or approach it in the intensity
of its moving force, to every enterprise,
great, difficult howsoever it might be
by which He would be honored.</p>

<p>Love has been the sovereign power in all
the Church. Judgment may be generous; love
is lavish. Judgment may be stedfast in its
conclusions; love is heroic in its affirmations.
It was love that garnished the house, and
poured out the spikenard, and spiced the
sepulcher. It was love that faced the flames,
as in Felicitas and Perpetua, fronting the
dungeon and not shrinking, fronting the
sword and not blanching. It was love that
said, "The nearer the sword, the nearer to
God." You can not conquer that power, indestructible,
full of a divine energy.</p>

<p>And with the experience of this comes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
vivid vision of the divine Providence, working
for the gospel in human history. How
wonderful it is! Look at the progress of the
last ninety years, since missionary work began
in this country! The changes, except as they
are matters of public record and of universal
personal observation, would be simply unthinkable&mdash;the
vast new machineries of travel
and of commerce; the incalculable additions
to the wealth of civilized lands; the ever-increasing
prosperity and power of Protestant
nations, in which the gospel is honored; the
equally ever-reduced power and lessening
fame of nations, ancient and famous, in which
the gospel is refused free movement with a
home among the people; the continually closer
approaches of civilized and Protestant nations
to each other, as of Great Britain and
this country. Many years ago Lord Brougham
said, you remember, "Not an ax falls in
the American forest but it sets in motion a
shuttle in Manchester." That has been true
ever since, and is more true to-day than ever
before. Not a mine is opened, not an industry
established, not a mechanism invented in the
one country, which is not recognized, and the
power of which is not felt, in the other; and
more and more their policies are weaving together,
not necessarily in form, but in fundamental,
underlying sympathy. All these
things are going forward with the opening
of regions and realms formerly inaccessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to Christianity; so that now the Christianity
which seemed buried in the catacombs, which
seemed burned up in the martyr fires, has
the freedom of the world, and may everywhere
be preached in its purity and its power. Here
are the plans of God going forward; and we
ought to feel in ourselves that in every hardest
work we do we are only keeping step with
the march of omnipotence.</p>

<p>I know that there are many who fear that
the prosperity of our times, the love of pleasure,
the desire for ease and enjoyment, are to
interfere with and stay these plans of the divine
Providence for the furtherance of
Christ's Church, and of His cause in the
world. I do not wonder at the fear, though
I do not share it. Unquestionably the secular
spirit is more intense and widely distributed
at this time than it ever was before, and the
opportunities for its gratification, in the acquirement
of wealth and in the enjoyment of
every luxury, are greater than ever before.
Undoubtedly it is true that Sunday observance
is far less strict, and family discipline
and training far less careful, than they were,
perhaps, in the days of our own childhood.
Sunday newspapers make almost all American
ministers wish they were Englishmen; and
Sunday observance among ourselves reminds
one too often of that colloquy between Joshua
and Moses as they were coming down from
the mount during the idol-feast, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
younger said, "There is a noise of war in the
camp." "No," said the elder and more discerning,
"it is not the voice of them that
shout for the mastery, neither is it the voice
of them that cry for being overcome, but it
is the voice of them that sing, that I hear."
Sometimes in our congregations I think it is
not the shout for the mastery of the truth,
pushing it upon men, it is not the voice of
them that cry, in penitence and humble obedience,
because they are overcome, but it is the
voice of them that sing that we hear; and the
singing is too often in operatic measures, and
done by quartets, not by congregations! Talleyrand
was right in saying years ago that
Americans take their pleasures sadly. I think
that we are right also, and more nearly right,
when we say that Americans take their religion
too lightly, too gaily, as if it were a varnish
upon life instead of a fire and power
within it.</p>

<p>But the human soul is still beating, and full
of life, in the heart of everyone whom we address;
and God's gospel has its grip on that
human soul whenever it reaches it through
our ministry, lifts it nearer the things supernal,
and nearer God Himself. While I see
many things to make us solicitous, I see nothing
to make us timid, concerning these mighty
advancing plans of God. If persecution could
not stay them, if prelacy could not finally
thwart them, I do not believe that bicycles are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
going to override them, in the end, or that
they are to find their grave in the fascinating
golf links. No! there is One who sitteth above
the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants
thereof are as grasshoppers; and His plans
go forth, soundless, silent, except as they come
into operation. But they never are broken;
they never are drawn back; and the world
has to learn more and more clearly, every century,
that the banners of God are those which
never go down in any struggle, and that whoever
walks and works with God is sure of the
triumph.</p>

<p>Then do not let us forget that this is the
sublime interval in history between the ascension
of the Master and His second coming in
power and glory, to judge the world! "In
a grand and awful time" the hymn says&mdash;and
I repeat it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We are living, we are dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In a grand and awful time,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">when the heavens have been luminous with
the splendor of the ascension, and are destined
to be luminous again with the awful
glory of the coming for judgment; and now
is our time for work&mdash;for work with the energy
of the divine Spirit whose dispensation
this is. That Spirit wrote His gospel by the
inspiration of human minds, and by the instruments
of human hands, on leaves of
parchment and papyrus. He is writing His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
gospel now, at large, through His inspiration
of human minds and guidance of human
hands over the expanses of the continents.
But it is the same gospel&mdash;the gospel of sin,
the gospel of atonement, the gospel of regeneration,
the gospel of future judgment, and of
future glory for the believing. That is the
gospel; and we are to go with Him in extending
the knowledge of that and in writing it
ourselves. Wheresoever we have the opportunity,
that is our work; a work greater, more
momentous, wider in its relations, than any
other done upon the earth.</p>

<p>Let us not forget then the meanness, the
misery and evilness, of human society, where
the gospel does not enter and pervade it. Let
us not forget the recoverableness to God of
every person and every people, if the divine
energies are rightly used. Let us not forget
that the gospel of Christ is the power at
which men laugh and say, "You are trying
to quarry mountains with sunbeams; you are
trying to lift masses of masonry with aerial
or, at best, with silken threads." It is the
gospel of Christ which is to be the power to
lift mankind, and glorify God, on all the continents,
in all the earth. The passion of love
for Christ, stimulated by everything that we
read or hear, quickened by the Spirit in our
hearts, is the power that is to loosen amassed
wealth and make it fluent, that is to vitalize
dead wealth and make it active, that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
enter into every languid heart and inspire
it for service. And then the view of the
divine Providence working in history toward
one result, steadily steering toward
one haven and port,&mdash;the earth renewed in
righteousness and beautiful before God; and
then this dispensation of the Spirit, in
which we have our time! After the resurrection,
a disciple said, "I go a-fishing."
Likewise said they all. It seems strange that
even after that miracle, which has shot its
radiance everywhere upon the history of the
world, any disciple should have yielded to
such an impulse. But now shall we, after
the ascension and when the skies are still
glowing with it, after Pentecost has opened
heavenly principalities and powers to our
view and our experience, under the shadow
of the great white throne that is to be set
in heaven&mdash;shall we go to building and bargaining,
to mining and merchandising, as our
chief aim in life, and omit this sublimest service
which angels, it seems to me, must bend
above the battlements of heaven to see in its
progress, and to make their hearts and harps
jubilant in its vitality and success?</p>

<p>Oh, my friends, let us remember, wheresoever
we labor, that our errand is to make this
complex, complete, energetic missionary motive
more clear to every mind, more thoroughly
vigorous and energetic in every heart.
Everything else must be postponed! Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
let us spend our strength in picking the gospel
to pieces, to see if we can't put it together
again in a better fashion! Do not let us spend
our strength in any denominational controversies
or collisions. Let us give ourselves,
with all our power, to making this immense
missionary motive operative throughout all
the churches, throughout and in all Christian
hearts; till He shall come whose right it is
to reign, and take unto Himself His great
power, and rule, King of nations as well as
King of saints. Let us recognize this as the
one truly magnificent errand for man on the
earth. Let us be filled with the Divine Spirit,
that we may accomplish it the more perfectly.
Let us never intermit the service. And if, as
we grow older, we grow weary with cares and
labors, and it may be with sorrows, and are
disposed sometimes to think we may now rest,
let us remember the word of Arnauld, the
illustrious Port Royalist, whom even his passionate
enemies, the Jesuits, admitted to be
great, of whom it is recorded that when some
one said to him, "You have labored long, now
is your time to rest!" his reply was, "Rest?
Why rest, here and now, when I have a whole
eternity to rest in!" God in His grace open
that tranquil and luminous eternity to each
of us, where we may find rest in nobler praise
and grander work, forevermore; and unto
Him be all the praise!</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">William Morley Punshon</span>, English
Methodist divine, was born at Doncaster,
in Yorkshire, in 1824. His style was brilliant
and elaborate, and while his sermons
were written out in the minutest detail
and carefully committed to memory, they
were delivered with a freshness and
vigor that rivaled the charm of extemporaneous
eloquence. Every word he
uttered was charged with the force and
vitality of his great personality. At the
Metropolitan Church, Toronto, Canada,
he preached for many years, drawing
thousands of people to Christ by the
zeal, magnetism and power of his pulpit
oratory. He died in 1881.</p>

<h4>ZEAL IN THE CAUSE OF CHRIST</h4>

<blockquote>

<p><em>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or
whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the
love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that
he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto him who died for
them, and rose again.</em>&mdash;2 Cor. v., 13-15.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is always an advantage for the advocate
of any particular cause to know the tactics
of his adversary. He will be the
better prepared for the onset, and repel the
attack the more easily. Forewarned of danger,
he will intrench himself in a position
from which it will be impossible to dislodge
him. The apostle Paul possest this advantage
in a very eminent degree. In the earlier
years of his apostleship, the Jew and the
Greek were the antagonists with whom he had
to contend. Having been himself a member
of the straitest sect of the Jews, he knew
full well the antipathy with which they regarded
anything which set itself by its simplicity
in contrast with their magnificent ritual;
and he knew also the haughty scorn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
which they turned away from what they
deemed the unworthy accessories of the Nazarene.
And, well read as he was in classic
literature, and acquainted with all the habits
and tendencies of the Grecian mind, he could
readily understand how the restraints of the
gospel would be deemed impertinent by the
voluptuous Corinthian, and how the philosophic
Athenian would brand its teachers
mad. And yet, rejoicing in the experimental
acquaintance with the gospel, he says, for his
standing-point of advantage: "We preach
Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block
and to the Greeks foolishness, but to
them that are called, the power of God and
the wisdom of God." And in the words of
the text, addressing some of those very Corinthians
upon whom the gospel had exerted its
power, he seems to accept the stigma and vindicate
the glorious madness: "For whether
we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether
we be sober it is for your cause. For the
love of Christ constraineth us; because we
thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead; and that he died for all, that they
who live should not henceforth live unto themselves,
but unto him who died for them, and
rose again." The great purpose of the apostle
in these words is to impress upon us the
fact that the cause of Christ in the world,
sanctioned by the weight of so many obligations,
fraught with the destinies of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
millions, should be furthered by every legitimate
means; that for it, if necessary, should
be employed the soberest wisdom; and for it,
if necessary, the most impassioned zeal. He
vindicates the use of zeal in the cause of
Christ by the three following considerations:
First, from the condition of the world; secondly,
from the obligations of the Church;
and, thirdly, from the master-motive of the
Savior's constraining love. To illustrate and
enforce this apostolic argument, as not inappropriate
to the object which has called us
together, will be our business for a few brief
moments to-night.</p>

<p>I. The apostle argues and enforces the use
of zeal in the cause of Christ, in the first
place, from the condition of the world. The
apostle speaks of the world as in a state of
spiritual death. He argues the universality
of this spiritual death from the universality
of the atonement of Christ. "For the love
of Christ constraineth us, because we thus
judge, that if one died for all, then were all
dead"&mdash;dead in sin, with every vice luxuriant
and every virtue languishing; dead in law,
judicially in the grasp of the avenger; nay,
"condemned already," and hastening to the
second death. We need not remind you that
this is by no means the world's estimate of
its own condition. It is short-sighted, and,
therefore, self-complacent. There is a veil
over its eye; there is a delusion at its heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
In that delusion it fancies itself enthroned
and stately, like some poor lunatic, an imaginary
monarch under the inflictions of its
keeper. The discovery of its true position
comes only when the mind is enlightened from
on high. "We thus judge," not because there
is in us any intuitional sagacity, or any
prophetical foresight, by which our judgment
is made more accurate than the judgment of
others; but the Holy Spirit has come down,
has wrought upon us&mdash;has shown us the
plague of our own hearts&mdash;and from the
death within us we can the better argue the
death which exists around. And that this is
the actual condition of the world, Scripture
and experience combine to testify. The Bible,
with comprehensive impartiality, concludes
all "under sin"; represents mankind as a
seed of evil-doers&mdash;"children that are corrupters"&mdash;sheep
that have wandered away
from the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls.
In the adjudication of Scripture there is no
exemption from this common character of
evil, and from this common exposure to danger.
The men of merciful charities, and the
woman of abandoned life&mdash;the proudest peer,
and the vilest serf in his barony&mdash;the moralist
observer of the decalogue, and the man-slayer,
red with blood, all are comprehended in the
broad and large denunciation: "Ye were by
nature children of wrath, even as others."
And out in the broad world, wherever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
observant eye travels, you have abundant confirmation
of the testimony of Scripture. You
have it in your own history. The transgressions
and sins which constitute this moral
death abound in our age no less than in any
former age of mankind. There are thousands
around you who revel in undisguised corruption.
There are thousands more externally
reputable who have only a name to live. You
have this confirmation in the nations of the
Continent&mdash;some safely bound by the superstition
of ages; others subsiding into a reactionary
skepticism. You have this confirmation
further away in the countries which own
Mohammedan rule, and cherish the Mohammedan's
dream&mdash;where you have unbridled
lust, and a tiger's thirst for blood. You have
this confirmation in the far-off regions of
heathenism proper, where the nature, bad in
itself, is made a thousand fold worse by its
religion&mdash;where the man is the prey of every
error, and the heart the slave of every cruelty&mdash;where
men live in destruction, and where
men die in despair. Travel where you will,
visit the most distant regions, and search
under the shadow of the highest civilization&mdash;penetrate
into the depths of those primeval
forests, into whose original darkness you
might have imagined the curse would hardly
penetrate, and the result is uniformly the
same. Death is everywhere. You see it, indeed,
in all its varieties now in the rare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fading beauty which it wears just after the
spirit has fled from the clay, when its repose
seems the worn-out casket, which the soul has
broken, and thrown away; now, when there
is shed over it a hue of the sublime, and it
is carried amid the tears to burial, and now,
when corruption has begun its work, and its
ill odor affects the neighborhood, and spreads
the pestilence&mdash;you see it in all its varieties,
but uniformly death is there. We gather from
our melancholy pilgrimage no vestige of spiritual
life. Mourners go about the streets, and
there are mourners over many tombs.</p>

<p>Altho, as we have observed just now, a
thorough and realizing estimate of the world's
condition comes only when the judgment is
enlightened from on high, the wise men of
the world, the minds that have in all ages
towered above their fellows, have felt an unsatisfactoriness
for which they could hardly
account; they have had a vague and morbid
consciousness that all was not right somehow,
either with themselves or with their race; they
have met with disturbing forces, signs of irregularity,
tokens of misery and of sin that
have ruffled, somewhat, the philosophic evenness
of their minds. Each in his own way,
and from his own standpoint, has guessed at
the solution of the problem, and has been
ready with a suggested remedy. The peoples
are imbruted; educate them. The nations are
barbarous; civilize them. Men grovel in sensual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
pleasure; cultivate the esthetic faculty;
open to them galleries of pictures; bring them
under the humanizing influences of art. Men
groan in bondage; emancipate them, and bid
them be free! Such are some of the tumultuous
cries that have arisen from earnest but
blind philanthropists, who have ignored the
spiritual part of man's nature, and forgotten
altogether the Godward relations of his soul.
All these, as might have been expected, valuable
enough as auxiliaries, worth something
to promote the growth and comfort of a man
when life has been once imparted, fail, absolutely
fail to quicken the unconscious dead.
In all cases the bed has been shorter than
that a man could lie on it, and the covering
narrower than that he could wrap himself in
it. The inbred death lay too deep for such
superficial alchemy; corpses can not by any
possibility animate corpses; and the compassionate
bystander from other worlds, sickened
with the many inventions, might be constrained
to cry, "Amid all this tumult of the
human, O for something divine!" And the
divine is given&mdash;Christ has died for all men.
There is hope for the world's life. This
is a death whereby we live; this is a remedy
commensurate with existing need, and intended
entirely to terminate and extinguish
that need.</p>

<p>That squalid savage, whose creed is a perpetual
terror, and whose life is a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
war&mdash;Christ hath died for him. That fettered
and despairing slave, into whose soul
the iron has entered, valued by his base oppressor
about on a par with the cattle he
tends, or with the soil he digs&mdash;Christ hath
died for him. That dark blasphemer, who
lives in familiar crime, whose tongue is set
on fire of hell, whose expatriation would be
hailed by the neighborhood around him as a
boon of chiefest value&mdash;Christ has died for
him. That dark recluse, whom an awakened
conscience harasses, and who, in the vain hope
of achieving merit by suffering, wastes himself
with vigilant penance well-nigh to the
grave&mdash;Christ has died for him. Oh, tell these
tidings to the world, and it will live. Prophesy
of this name in the motionless valley,
and the divine Spirit who always waits to do
honor to Jesus will send the afflatus from the
four winds of heaven, and they shall leap into
life to His praise.</p>

<p>Now take these two points. Think in the
first place, of the condition of the world&mdash;a
condition so disastrous, that nothing but death
can illustrate it&mdash;a condition which prostrates
every faculty, which smites the body with
unnumbered cruelties, which dwarfs the mind
with prejudices or distorts it into unholy passion,
which banishes the soul and mind within
a man in hopeless estrangement from happiness
and God; and then think of the death
of Christ, providing for the furthest need,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
overtaking the utmost exile, pouring its abundant
life upon the sepulchered nations, diffusing
light, liberty, hope, comfort, heaven: and
I appeal to your enlightened judgment
whether you are not bound, those of you who
believe in Jesus, to labor for the world's conversion
with intensest energy and zeal. Oh,
if temporal miseries elicit sympathy, and
prompt to help; if the anxieties of a neighborhood
gather around a drowning child, or are
fastened upon the rafters of a burning house,
where, solitary and imploring, stands a single
man, already charred by the flame, how much
of sympathy, of effort, of liberality, of zeal,
of prayer, are due to a world lying in the
wicked one, and panting after the second
death! You will agree with me, that there
is more than license for the poet's words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On such a theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis impious to be calm!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">And you will rejoice&mdash;will you not? to take
your stand to-night by the apostle's side, and
to cry, when men deem your zeal impertinence
and your efforts fanaticism, "If we be beside
ourselves, it is to God: and if we be sober, it
is for your cause."</p>

<p>II. The apostle argues the necessity for
zeal in the cause of Christ, secondly, from
the obligations of the Church, in that He died
for all, that they should live&mdash;should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but for Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
who died for them and rose again. The
apostle's argument is this&mdash;none of us has
life in himself; if we live at all, we live by
imparted life; we live because life has been
drafted into our spirits from on high. Then
it is not our own; it belongs to Him who has
purchased it for us with His own blood, and
we are bound to employ it in His service, and
for His glory. This also is the conclusion of
an enlightened judgment. We judge this as
well as the other, and this is in accordance
with the whole tenor of Scripture. Time
would fail us to mention a tithe of the passages
in which devotion&mdash;the devotion of the
heart and of the service of God are made
matter of constant and of prominent demand.
I will just mention one passage that may
serve as an illustration of all: "I beseech you
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye give your bodies as a living sacrifice."
Have you ever gaged the depth of consecration
that slumbers in the heart of those words&mdash;"a
living sacrifice"; to be absolutely and
increasingly devoted to God, as if the knife
were at the throat, and the life-blood streamed
forth in votive offering? Nay, better than
that; because the life-blood could stream out
but once, but the living sacrifice may be a
perpetual holocaust, repeated daily for a lifetime&mdash;a
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
unto God, which is your reasonable service.
From the doctrine of this passage, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
numberless others kindred to it, it would appear
that the regenerate heart is not at liberty
to live for itself, nor to aim supremely at its
own gratification; it must live for Him who
has died for it, and who has risen again.
You can not fail, I think, to perceive that
compliance with this exhortation is utterly
antagonistic to the ordinary procedure of
mankind.</p>

<p>In the age of organization against idolatry,
there is one proud, rampant idolatry which
retains its ascendency amongst us. Selfishness
is the most patronized idolatry in the
world. It is the great image whose brightness
is exceeding terrible, and before which all
men bow; it is a throne, and an empire, and
the likeness of a kingly crown; it equips
armies and mans armaments to gratify its
lust of power. Fastnesses have been explored
and caverns ransacked to appease its thirst
for gold. It presides over the councils of
kings and over the diplomacy of cabinets;
for it the merchantman grindeth down his
manhood, for it the treader-under-foot of
nations marcheth in his might and in his
shame; its votaries are of all handicrafts&mdash;of
the learned professions, and of every walk
in life. It hath sometimes climbed on to the
judgment-seat, and perverted justice there.
The cowled monk hath hidden it beneath his
robe, and it hath become for him an engine
of oppression, and it hath occasionally robed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
itself in holy vestments, and entered the
priest's office for a morsel of bread. No
grace or virtue of humanity is free from its
contamination. It has breathed, and patriotism
has degenerated into partisanship; it has
breathed, and friendship has been simulated
for policy; it has breathed, and charity has
been blemished by ostentation; it has
breathed, and religion has been counterfeited
for gold; its sway is a despotism&mdash;its territory
wherever man hath trodden, and it is the undisputed
anarch of the world. Now it is
against this principle in human nature,
throned within us all, doggedly contesting
every inch of ground, that Christianity goes
forth to combat. The gospel absolutely refuses
to allow self to be the governing power,
and assaults it in all its strongholds with precepts
of sublime morality. To the selfishness
of avarice it goes up boldly, even while the
miser clutches his gold, and says: "Give to
him that asketh of thee, and from him that
would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
To the selfishness of anger it addresses itself,
even when the red spot is yet on the brow of
the angry: "Let not the sun go down upon
thy wrath"; "Bless them that curse you,
pray for them that despitefully use you and
persecute you." To the selfishness of pride,
even in its haughtiness and arrogance, it says:
"In honor preferring one another, be clothed
with humility, let each esteem another better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
than himself." To the selfishness of indifference
to the concerns of others, "Look not
on thine own things, but likewise upon the
things of others"; and to the selfishness of
souls and criminal neglect of the great salvation,
it speaks in tones of pathos which that
must be a callous heart that can withstand,
"Ye know the graces of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who, tho he was rich, yet for our sins he became
poor, that we, through his poverty,
might be made rich." Oh, how small, alongside
of august and heavenly precepts like
these, are the sublimest maxims of any merely
ethical morality!</p>

<p>It is said that, once, during the performance
of a comedy in the Roman theater, one
of the actors gave utterance to the sentiment,
"I am a man; nothing, therefore, that is human
can be foreign to me," and the audience
were so struck by the disinterestedness, or so
charmed by the novelty, that they greeted it
with thunders of applause. How much greater
wealth of kindly wisdom and prompting to
unselfish action lies hidden in the gospel of
Christ, shrined there as every-day utterances
passed by the most of us very slightingly by!
Oh! let there be anything like the genial practise
of this divine morality, and the world
would soon lose its aspect of desolation and
of blood; oppression and over-reaching, and
fraud and cruelty, would be frowned out of
the societies of men, and this earth would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
once more an ample and a peopled paradise.
By selfishness, as we have thus endeavored to
describe it, we mean that grasping, monopolizing
spirit which gets all and gives nothing;
heedful enough of its own fortunes, careless
of the concerns and interests of others. This
is the principle in our nature which Christianity
opposes, and with which it ceaselessly
wages war. But there is a sort of selfishness
which, for the sake of distinction, we may
call self-love, which is instinctive, and therefore
innocent&mdash;that merciful provision by
which we are prompted to the care of our
own lives and to the avoidance of everything
that would disquiet or abridge them. This
principle in our nature Christianity encourages;
to this principle Christianity addresses
itself; and hence it has connected, married in
indissoluble union, man's chiefest duty and
man's highest pleasure. Godliness is profitable
unto all things, having the promise of
the life that now is. What has the dark, morbid,
unhappy sensualist to do with it? Godliness
hath the promise of the life "that now
is," as well as "that which is to come." In
keeping Thy commandments there is a present
reward. "Take my yoke upon you and
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls;
for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
"In thy presence there is fulness of joy; at
thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Just as it is in man's physical organization,
and its adaptation to the material
world around him, when body and mind are
alike in health, we can neither eat, nor drink,
nor walk, nor sleep, nor sing, nor perform
any of the commonest actions of life without
a sensation of pleasure; so it is in the spiritual
life: there is pleasure in its every motion.
There is pleasure even in the sting of penitence;
it is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A godly grief and pleasing smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That melting of a broken heart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">There is pleasure in the performance of duty;
there is pleasure in the enjoyment of privilege;
there is pleasure in the overcoming of
temptations, a grand thrill of happiness to
see trampled under foot a vanquished lust or
slain desire; there is pleasure in the exercise
of benevolence; there is pleasure in the importunity
of prayer. Hence it is that the
apostle seeks to rivet the sense of personal
obligation by the remembrance of personal
benefit. "We thus judge, that he died for
all, that they which live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto him who"&mdash;owns
them? No. Claims them? No. Will
judge them? No; but&mdash;"to him who died
for them and rose again." Gratitude is to
be the best prompter to our devotion. Those
who live to Christ, those who live by Christ,
will not tamely see His altars forsaken, His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Sabbaths desecrated, His name blasphemed,
the blood of the covenant wherewith He was
sanctified accounted an unholy thing. Brethren,
are you of that happy family? Have you
obtained life from the dead through His
name? Then you are bound to spend it for
His honor, and, watching with godly jealousy
for every possible opportunity of doing good,
to spend and be spent for them who have not
yet your Master known. I call on you to
answer this invocation; it belongs to you.
There is no neutrality, believe me, in this war&mdash;and
if there be some of you that would like
to be dastardly and half-hearted trimmers,
you will find by and by that you have got
the hottest place in the battle, exposed to the
cross-fire from the artillery of both parties.
I call on you decisively to-night to answer
this invocation. Call up before your minds
the benefits you have individually received;
think of the blessings which the death of
Christ has procured for you&mdash;the removal of
the blighting curse which shadowed all your
life, the present sense of pardon, mastery over
self and over sin, light in the day of your
activity, and songs in the night of your travail;
the teaching Spirit to lead you into
still loftier knowledge, and the sanctifying
Spirit to impress upon you the image of the
heavenly; that divine fellowship which lightens
the present, and that majestic hope which
makes the future brighter far. Think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
benefits which the resurrection of Christ has
conferred upon you; light in the shadowed
valley, the last enemy destroyed, support amid
the swellings of Jordan, a guide upon the
hither side of the flood, angelic welcomes, the
King in his beauty, and "a house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens." And
then, as the sum of favor is presented, and
gratitude arises and the fire burns, and the
heart is full, and the frame quivers with the
intensity of its emotions, just remember that
there is a world lying in the wicked one, that
there are multitudes, thousands upon thousands,
in your own city, at your own doors,
for whom the Savior died, who never heard
His name; that there are multitudes for whom
He has abolished death who have never felt
His resurrection's power. Let your tears
flow; better, far better a tear for God's sake
and the world's sake than the hard-heartedness
and darkness of sin. Lift up your voice
in the midst of them; lift it up, be not afraid.
Say unto the cities of Judah, "Behold your
God." Men will call you mad, but you can
give them the apostle's answer, "If we be
beside ourselves, it is to God; if we be sober,
it is for your cause."</p>

<p>III. The apostle argues the necessity of zeal
in the cause of Christ, in the third place, from
the master motive of the Savior's constraining
love. "The love of Christ constraineth us"&mdash;forces
us along, carries us away as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
impetuosity of a torrent, or rather as when
cool heavens and favoring air speed the vessel
steadily to the haven. Love is at once man's
most powerful motive and his highest inspiration,
both in the life that now is and that
which is to come. From love to Christ spring
the most devoted obedience, the most untiring
efforts in His service. There are other springs
of action, I know, by which men are influenced
to a profession of religion. Interest can occasionally
affect godliness from sordid aims,
and behave itself decorously amid the respectabilities
of the temple-going and almsgiving
religion; but it will give its arm to any man
that goes down to the house of Rimmon; and
if there is a decree that at the sound of all
kinds of music they are to fall down before
another image which has been erected in the
plains of Dura, they will be the most obsequious
benders of the knee. Men sometimes
practise obedience under the influence of fear.
A sudden visitation, a prevailing epidemic, an
alarming appeal, will strike into momentary
concern; but when the indignation is overpast,
and the craven soul has recovered from
its paroxysms of terror, there will often be
a relapse into more than the former atrocities
of evil. Convictions of duty may and sometimes
will induce a man, like an honest Pharisee
of the olden time, to observe rigidly the
enactments of the law; but there will be no
heart in his obedience, and no holy passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in his soul; but let the love of God be shed
abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given
unto him, let there be a perception of love in
God, let there be sight of the Crucified as well
as of the cross, and there will be disinterested,
and cheerful, and hearty obedience. Zeal for
God will become at once a passion and a principle,
intensifying every purpose into ardor,
and filling the whole soul with vehemence of
absorbing desire. This is the emotion from
whose natural and inevitable outflow the
apostle vindicates impassioned zeal.</p>

<p>Opinions are divided as to whether the constraining
love spoken of in the text refers
to Christ's love to us or to our love to Him,
which the sense of His love has enkindled in
the soul. I do not think we can go far wrong
if we take both meanings, inasmuch as no
principle of exposition is violated, and as we
need the pressure of a combination of motive,
that we may be zealously affected always in
this good thing. Ye, then, if there are any
of you here who need rousing to energy in
the service of Christ, think of His love to you;
how rich its manifestations, and how unfeigned;
how all other love of which it is possible
for you to conceive shrinks in the comparison!
There have been developments in
the histories of years of self-sacrificing affection,
which has clung to the loved object amid
hazard and suffering, and which has been
ready even to offer up life in its behalf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Orestes and Pylades, Damon and Pythias,
David and Jonathan, what lovely episodes
their histories give us amid a history of selfishness
and sin! Men have canonized them,
partly because such instances are rare, and
partly because they are like a dim hope of
redemption looming from the ruins of the
fall. We have it on inspired authority, indeed,
"Greater love hath no man than this"&mdash;this
is the highest point which man can
compass, this is the culminating point of that
affection which man can by possibility attain,
the apex of his loftiest pyramid goes no higher
than this&mdash;"greater love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his
friend; but God commendeth his love toward
us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ
died for us." A brother has sometimes made
notable efforts to retrieve a brother's fortunes,
or to blanch his sullied honor; but there is a
Friend that sticketh closer than a brother. A
father has bared his breast to shield his offspring
from danger, and a mother would
gladly die for the offspring of her womb; but
a father's affection may fail in its strength,
and yet more rarely a mother's in its tenderness.</p>

<p>And "can a woman forget her sucking child,
that she should not have compassion on the
son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet
will I not forget thee." O Jesus of Nazareth,
who can declare Thee? "Herein is love, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins."
Think of that love&mdash;love which desertion could
not abate&mdash;love which ingratitude could not
abate&mdash;which treachery could not abate&mdash;love
which death could not destroy&mdash;love which,
for creatures hateful and hating one another,
stooped to incarnation, and suffered want, and
embraced death, and shrank not even from
the loathesomeness and from the humiliation
of burial; and then, with brimming eye, and
heart that is full of wonder: "Why such love
to me?" you will indeed be ungrateful if
you are not stirred by it to an energy of consecration
and endeavor, which may well seem
intemperate zeal to cool reckoners with
worldly wisdom.</p>

<p>Then take the other side of the argument;
take it as referring to your love to Christ,
which the sense of His love has enkindled in
the soul. The deepest affection in the believing
heart will always be the love of Jesus.
The love of home, the love of friends, the
love of letters, the love of rest, the love of
travel, and all else, are contracted by the
side of this master passion. "A little
deeper," said one of the veterans of the first
Napoleon's old guard, when they were probing
in his bosom for a bullet that had mortally
wounded him, and he thought they were getting
somewhere in the region of the heart&mdash;"a
little deeper and you will find the Emperor."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Engraven on the Christian's heart
deeper than all other love of home or friends,
with an ineffaceable impression that nothing
can erase, you find the loved name of Jesus.
Oh! let this affection impel us, and who shall
measure our diligence or repress our zeal?
Love is not bound by rule; there is no law
that can bind it; it is never below the precept,
it is always up to the precept, but it always
has a margin of its own. It does not calculate,
with mathematical exactitude, with how
little of obedience it can escape penalty and
secure recompense; like its Master it gives in
princely style; it is exuberant in its manifestations;
there is always enough and to spare.
And if meaner motive can prompt to heroic
action&mdash;if from pure love of science astronomers
can cross the ocean familiarly, and dare
encounter dangers, just that they may watch
in distant climes the transit of a planet across
the disc of the sun&mdash;and if botanists can
travel into inhospitable climes and sojourn
among inhospitable men, only to gather specimens
of their gorgeous flora&mdash;and if, with no
motive but love of country, and no recompense
save bootless tears and an undying
name, a Willoughby could sacrifice himself
to blow up a magazine, and a Sarkeld could
fire the Cashmere Gate at Delhi, surely we,
with obligations incomparably higher, with
the vows of profession on our lips, with death
busy in the midst of us, and souls going down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
from our doors into a joyless and blasted immortality,
ought to present our life-blood, if
need be, for the cause of Christ, and for the
good of souls. Let the scoffers spurn at us
as they will; we are far superior to such poor
contumely. Heaven applauds our enthusiasm,
and we vindicate it in the apostle's words:
"If we be beside ourselves, it is to God; and
if we be sober, it is for your cause."</p>
